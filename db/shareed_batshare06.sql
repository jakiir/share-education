I was almost forbidden to do things I didn&#8217;t really love. My parents insisted on trying things and finding that deep passion. But I didn&#8217;t have to search and try. I always knew what I&#8217;d be when I grow up. As long as I remember, there was no doubt.</p>\n<h3>A classical musician</h3>\n<p>When I was 8 my mom took me to local music school for entrance examination. I was in! Oh, joy! Finally I was learning to play and sing, to read and write this new language. Italian. Oh, music scores too! There was a whole new world that my parents, or anyone in my family, didn&#8217;t know anything about and I was stepping into it. I was doing just fine in it.. and I couldn&#8217;t live outside of it.</p>\n<p>As time passed, I finished elementary and high music school, went to music Academy, almost finished it and then my mother died. It was 2003. Two weeks later I found out I was pregnant. There was no time for grief and I couldn&#8217;t feel the joy. I just switched off and turned to the facts: I became a mom and a wife and I needed a job.</p>\n<p>And what a job did I found. An opera prompter. Opera Prompter! God, I love that job. Every second of it for ten years. I was yelling at singers, singing, conducting, traveling, laughing and crying. My Italian was significantly improved. Working time was great &#8211; so much free time to be a mom, study for Academy, get a hobby&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Opera prompter&#8217;s hobby</h3>\n<p>In 2007 I was administrator in one English speaking forum with focus on software and hardware topics. It helped me to significantly improve my English. And my tech knowledge. Which was close to none when I registered. As one of administrators, occasionally I had to tweak site here and there. It was great! There was this code and when I would change something in code it would show on the site. Neat! I loved reading those files, finding patterns and parts written in humanly understandable forms. Later I learned those were called loops and conditionals. Also later I learned that this language is called PHP and that many other languages for building websites exist. Forum script was phpBB3.</p>\n<p>I was never a gamer. Never understood the point of game, besides finishing it. I guess PHP was to me what games are to passionate gamers. Like a puzzle or sudoku.</p>\n<p>At the same time my marriage was turning from bad into worse and in the beginning of 2008 I finally decided it was enough. We were working on Mozart&#8217;s â€œDon Giovanniâ€� in Theater. I remember this so clearly because my divorce was just turning from bad into worse. Those few months lasted for centuries after which I still needed a lot of time to recover what&#8217;s left of my self-esteem. My complete mental and emotional health was destroyed after years of domestic violence.</p>\n<p>2009 was important year for me. The cognition of possibility to have local server on my own machine and test everything before executing it on live site turned out to be very helpful.</p>\n<p>In October I needed a blog script and friend recommended WordPress. It was 2.9 version. It didn&#8217;t really work well but everyone was writing about it. There were at least 5 new tutorials on various blogs every day. I was digesting them every morning with my first coffee. The ones I really liked I even reproduced in my shiny new localhost. Soon enough I developed a local monster with different widgets on each page, future posts archive, post series done with custom fields and God knows whatnot. This WordPress was slowly taking over my free time. Every second of it.</p>\n<h3>So, the WordPress it is</h3>\n<p>One day a friend of mine asked me to build him a website for his ensemble. And for money. Money? I never thought of getting money for this. This was too good of a hobby. But he&#8217;s a friend so I did it. Then another friend showed up with the same request. And another.. I became freelance WordPress developer before I could even understand what was happening. It wasn&#8217;t really a favor to friends any more. I was a single mom with mortgage. My daughter was in primary school, life costs became serious while the art-and-culture salary was silently and regularly reduced.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was freelancing every single minute I could. Sleeping was luxury I could afford on weekends.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My dad was helping me tremendously. He was babysitting during theater&#8217;s rehearsals and performances in the evenings. When I&#8217;d get home, my daughter was sleeping, tomorrow&#8217;s meals cooked, dishes done and shinning.. I could go on like this but it was uncertain for how long.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2013 I was recovering from what was supposed to be routine gallbladder surgery and what nearly cost me life. Almost fully operational, I was getting ready for next roller coaster known as a mix of school year, freelancing and theater&#8217;s season. Then my father died. Suddenly. In an accident.</p>\n<p>Oh, this screaming silence..</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t think. Or breathe. For months. I needed someone to put the roller coaster on pause. Just.. Just a short one. To take a breathe. But there was no one. I was all alone with a 9 years old child who had to grow up fast. I had to grow up fast.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All of a sudden I realized that I can not afford a single mistake any more. I can not be ill, get in debts, lose job. Or mind. I was the only one I could count on.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2014 my theater salary got reduced once again. And again in following year. 30% in total. For ten years it never covered all of my monthly expenses but this was ridiculous. It was a time for me to stop playing it safe and see what I&#8217;m made of. That was probably the most difficult decision I have ever made. A heart breaking one. Stop being musician. So I quit being Opera Prompter and started working as a full time WordPress developer.</p>\n<h3>Well, hello, World!</h3>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t really know for which wage level my knowledge was. For years I was the only WordPress developer I knew in person. The rest were all online superstars I was learning from. So I started as a shy medior and the only WordPress developer in agency. It turns out that, for this agency needs, I was senior and soon enough I was organizing and leading development processes for new projects.</p>\n<p>From the business point of view repeating similar projects makes you &#8220;niche expert&#8221;. I do understand that. But, as many other developers out there, I don&#8217;t like repeating the same tasks or projects. Not even once. I missed variety which led me to become more active contributor on wordpress.org.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For years I was just contributing to codex here and there and never really thought about all the people behind WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In my vague image, they were a bunch of really great developers and they were doing just fine. I was learning from them so I could not possibly help them. I would just be on their way.</p>\n<p>However, in my attempt to find something interesting to keep my mind amused with, I came upon <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Slack url</a> for communication between contributors on WordPress project. What a crowd! And not just developers &#8211; everyone! Doing all kinds of different bits, and all important. How odd. WordPress is not like any other open source community I saw before. So much more open and inviting! I remember reading through channels and thinking: &#8220;I could do this&#8221;, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d love to learn that&#8221;, &#8220;This person is funny&#8221;.. I&#8217;m gonna stick.</p>\n<h3>Antisocial extrovert in a more open open source community</h3>\n<p>No matter how I tried, and I did try, I&#8217;m just not a people person. Among other antisocial treats, over the years I have developed a heavy dark humor which, more often than not, due to lack of social interactions I reveal in a completely wrong way. But these people seem not to mind so I thought to give it a try with them. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/code-of-conduct/\">Code of Conduct</a> is extremely important in WordPress community. No community wants bullies. But rare communities accept social weirdos and misfits. And this one doesn&#8217;t just accept them, it makes them feel like fits. That was a nice change.</p>\n<p>I started attending local <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WP-Meetup-NS/\">Meetups</a>, even gave <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WP-Meetup-NS/events/235186967/\">a talk</a> on contributing to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/\">Theme Review team</a> after which I was invited to join <a href=\"https://www.toptal.com/\">Toptal platform</a> as a freelance developer. My social adventure got me volunteering on <a href=\"https://2017.belgrade.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Belgrade</a> and <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Europe in Paris</a>. I must admit there were &#8220;too many people at the same time&#8221; moments but there were lots of ways to stay involved with controlled dose of human interactions. I chose volunteering at Experts bar and it worked out just great. I really loved all the hugs though.</p>\n<p>Today I try to keep my focus on just a few channels in make WordPress slack and my contribution wish list regularly updated. One can have only so many hours in a day. Most often you&#8217;ll find me in <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2Fdocs\">#docs</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2Fcore-docs\">#core-docs</a> channels, doing various stuff with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/about-the-docs-team/get-involved/\">Documentation</a> team.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/milana-cap_wcbgd.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2036 size-large\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/milana-cap_wcbgd-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Milana, on a rooftop baclony with some other people looking at her phone\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /></a></p>\n<h3>The Questions</h3>\n<p>Among all the questions I get about my professional path, the most commons are &#8220;<strong>How come you made such a huge change from music to web development?</strong>&#8220;, &#8220;<strong>Did you go to school to become a developer</strong>?&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Do you miss being musician?</strong>&#8220;. Answer to the first question is quite easy:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Being musician and writing code are pretty much the same. They both require the same parts of your mental struggle and make you go through the same emotional tortures and enlightenments.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The second question, however, is a bit more difficult to answer. In the light of the first answer, I could say that I was exposed to the required way of thinking. Practicing an instrument 6 hours per day for over a decade does teach you a couple of things about commitment. World of classical music is a world of magnificent talents and varieties which touches you all the way to the humble self where you find appreciation for being able to feel this way. Personally, I believe this is extremely important for developer &#8211; to be humble and grateful to person who helped them find this humbleness.</p>\n<p>No, I don&#8217;t have a formal developer&#8217;s education. It doesn&#8217;t seem to prevent me from being developer. And no, I don&#8217;t miss being musician. Because I never stopped being one. I listen to classical music while I code and play piano when I have a difficult programming problem to solve. Feels so natural.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to say that everything turned out pretty good at the end but, as my father used to say: &#8220;Life is the greatest screenplay writer&#8221; and my life seems to be the witty one too. In expectation of future turns I&#8217;d recommend <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4788Tmz9Zo&t=884s\">Beethoven&#8217;s Symphony No.7, II movement</a>, some very loud laughs and lots of WordPress loops.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: The Greatest Screenplay Writer\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Greatest%20Screenplay%20Writer&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgreatest-screenplay-writer%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: The Greatest Screenplay Writer\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgreatest-screenplay-writer%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgreatest-screenplay-writer%2F&title=The+Greatest+Screenplay+Writer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: The Greatest Screenplay Writer\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/greatest-screenplay-writer/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/081617-150x150.jpg&description=The Greatest Screenplay Writer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: The Greatest Screenplay Writer\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/greatest-screenplay-writer/\" title=\"The Greatest Screenplay Writer\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/greatest-screenplay-writer/\">The Greatest Screenplay Writer</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 12:00:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Milana Cap\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: WordPress Mobile Apps Updated with a New Login Experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74197\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-mobile-apps-updated-with-a-new-login-experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4765:\"<p>The WordPress mobile apps are sporting <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/08/15/an-updated-login-coming-to-the-wordpress-mobile-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">a new login experience</a> that Automattic&#8217;s mobile designers and developers released in the latest versions. The login flow has been completely redesigned to provide a more unified experience for connecting both self-hosted and WordPress.com-hosted sites. These flows were completely separate in the past and users were often confused about which one to select. The new design provides fewer opportunities for friction when logging in, an experience that likely determines many users&#8217; first impressions of the app.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/self-hosted-login-wp-mobile-apps.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Self-hosted login on mobile apps\n<p>&#8220;As we reimagined the login experience, there were a few key principles guiding us: keep it simple, minimize the distinction between a site hosted at WordPress.com versus somewhere else, and avoid anything that might be too clever,&#8221; Automattic mobile lead Eric Johnson said.</p>\n<p>Users can now connect new sites by entering the URL and the mobile apps will automatically detect if the site is hosted on WordPress.com or not. The new login flow ferries users on to the next step based on what kind of site is being connected. This is available in version 8.0 of WordPress for Android and version 8.2 of WordPress for iOS.</p>\n<p>The new login experience emphasizes the ease of using magic links for logging into WordPress.com. If the user enters and email address, the app will generate an authentication link and send it via email. This allows users to login without having to remember or enter a password.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/new-login-experience-wp-mobile-apps.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>If a user is entering the world of WordPress for the first time through the mobile apps, the new login experience also offers a short tour of the some of the features included in the app. These include WordPress.com features such as notifications, Stats, and the Reader. The apps, despite being marketed as the official WordPress mobile apps, are a product of Automattic and include a commercial upgrade path for WordPress.com services.</p>\n<p>The idea of the apps functioning as a gateway to help the greater WordPress ecosystem gain more users (and eventually see some graduate to self-hosted sites), no longer seems credible now that WordPress.com has <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-coms-business-plan-gives-subscribers-a-way-to-tap-into-wordpress-orgs-third-party-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\">entered the hosting space by allowing its customers to tap into third-party plugins and themes</a>.</p>\n<p>The updated login experience, while more convenient for users, continues to blur the line between self-hosted and WordPress.com-hosted sites. WordPress for Android and iOS used to have their own separate blogs but all of the news is now funneled through WordPress.com&#8217;s news blog and the @WordPressiOS and @WPAndroid Twitter accounts seemed to have been abandoned in favor of marketing updates through WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>In the past, many in the WordPress community have asked why the apps are not called the WordPress.com mobile apps, since they include features that are not central to the core publishing experience for self-hosted users. Last year when I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-android-5-7-adds-path-to-upgrade-wordpress-com-plan\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed</a> Maxime Biais, one of Automatticâ€™s mobile engineers, he said the team had considered splitting the product into two apps.</p>\n<p>â€œWe considered having both WordPress and WordPress.com apps, but we rejected this because it doesnâ€™t make it more clear,â€� Bias said. â€œItâ€™s probably even more ambiguous when someone searches the Play Store for &#8216;WordPress&#8217; or &#8216;Blog&#8217; and finds both WordPress and WordPress.com apps.â€�</p>\n<p>Now that that mobile apps have become a direct pipeline for new WordPress.com hosting customers, it may be time to re-visit the consideration of splitting the apps into two distinct products: one for WordPress.com&#8217;s commercial interests and one that officially represents the open source WordPress project for self-hosted users without any corporate interests. If the project&#8217;s official mobile apps are a key part of new users&#8217; onboarding experience, they should accurately represent the software as an independent platform that can be hosted with and extended by any number of free and commercial products in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 06:33:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US to Experiment With A Community Bazaar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74138\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-to-experiment-with-a-community-bazaar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2242:\"<p>In addition to taking place in a new location this year, <a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US</a> will have a <a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/attendee-information/community-bazaar/\">Community Bazaar</a>. An area will be set aside in the venue allowing those chosen to showcase their WordPress communities. Raquel Landefeld, Randy Hicks, and Dustin Mezo are organizing the Bazaar.</p>\n<p>Landefeld says the idea was inspired by the people who make up the WordPress Community. &#8220;We recognize that some local WordPress communities are thriving and some are just getting started,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What better way to help build community then by showcasing our local communities to the world. The thought is that smaller, newer, and communities just in their infancy, will be inspired with fresh ideas and or how-tos from the bigger and more established WordPress communities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The idea is similar to that of a science fair where each community chosen will have a space to highlight why theirs is awesome.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the event is to inspire growth while providing an opportunity for communities to learn from each other. There will also be metrics shared such as, number of meetup and WordCamp attendees, meetups per month, and unique qualities pertaining to the local groups.</p>\n<p>The organizing team is looking for the inside scoop on local communities. &#8220;This is all about you and your local WordPress community,&#8221; Landefeld said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is your time to shine. Why is your community different, special, or amazing? Be showy! Forget modesty. Let your communityâ€™s awesomeness be a tool to inspire other WP communities just getting started or striving.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last year saw record growth for WordPress community events.

Two years after Human Made began searching for a buyer, maekit purchased WP Remote to integrate it with the company&#8217;s existing platform that caters to designers managing multiple clients.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Remote had remained a much-loved product with its users and despite receiving no ongoing development it had remained an iconic plugin in the WordPress community,&#8221; Human Made CEO Tom Willmot said.</p>\n<p>maekit took over WP Remote operations in March after closing the deal. According to maekit CEO Matt Holme, the company inherited 20,000 users with 120,000 WordPress websites. His team has maintained WP Remote in its original platform for the past few months before integrating it into maekit last week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpremote.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Remote</a> has offered unlimited, free WordPress site management (updating core, plugins, and themes with a single click) since 2010. It hasn&#8217;t received ongoing development for several years, but maekit plans to add backup features that will make bring it more up to speed with competitors like MangeWP, MainWP, and InfiniteWP.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We definitely plan to keep WP Remote free and expand its features,&#8221; Holme said. &#8220;Specifically we are looking at offering easy-to-manage cloud-based backup services. For example, hook up your Dropbox (or any other popular cloud based storage system) and schedule regular backups of your WP websites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>maekit&#8217;s acquisition of WP Remote gives the company&#8217;s customers the ability to deploy WordPress sites with one click and manage client sites and domains through a unified, white-labeled invoicing and payment system. The company has rolled out a few long-overdue bug fixes to WP Remote and Holme says the rest of maekit is functional but still technically in a closed beta mode.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our revenue model revolves around direct sale hosting plans and also reselling integrated hosting plans for other leading global hosting providers,&#8221; Holme said. &#8220;We are refining the free invoicing and payment processing system built into maekit so that a maekit / WP Remote user can deploy a new hosted WP and charge their client a recurring monthly fee and retain the mark up they add on top of our base hosting prices as profit. This means literally no out of pocket expense for maekit / WP Remote users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although maekit&#8217;s one-click deployment service supports many popular CMS&#8217;s and e-commmerce platforms, including WordPress, Opencart, Drupal, Magento, and Joomla, Holme said the vast majority of the company&#8217;s customers are running on WordPress. Acquiring WP Remote brings a host of valuable new features to maekit&#8217;s customer base. maekit&#8217;s built-in client billing features, customized for freelancers and agencies, are what Holme says will differentiate the company from its competitors in the WordPress space.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have a great deal of respect for these other WP management platforms and feel the size of the WP market means there is opportunity for all to succeed,&#8221; Holme said. &#8220;With the features of maekit also including new website deployment, invoicing, payment processing and client management, our platform is unique from the others.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 03:50:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.8.0 Introduces 5 New Blocks: Categories, Text Columns, Shortcode, Audio, and Video\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-8-0-introduces-5-new-blocks-categories-text-columns-shortcode-audio-and-video\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5712:\"<p>Gutenberg <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/whats-new-in-gutenberg-11th-august/\" target=\"_blank\">0.8.0</a> was released over the weekend with five new blocks, major improvements to existing blocks, and support for more publishing features that have been missing from the new editor&#8217;s sidebar. The release also carries out the controversial decision to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/user-tracking-to-be-removed-from-gutenberg-in-upcoming-0-8-0-release\" target=\"_blank\">remove the opt-in usage tracking code from the plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2102\" target=\"_blank\">Categories block</a> can be found under the Widgets section, as it&#8217;s output is based on the existing categories widget.

The settings include a sliding scale for selecting 2-4 columns.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/text-columns-block-e1502741151590.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Contributors are calling the Text Block &#8220;an initial exploration&#8221; of multiple columns for text-only content. Depending on testing, it may not be the implementation that ends up landing in the plugin permanently.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been over how difficult it is to get columns right, and also how already today third parties can build this,&#8221; Joen Asmussen <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2117#issuecomment-319347010\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;We may very well want an entirely different implementation than this one. But perhaps it&#8217;s good to get this in now and test it. Perhaps this can help inform how a better column implementation can work down the road. In fact we might want to merge this block in now, only to take it back out later again, same as the Cover Text block. For that reason, I think it&#8217;d be good to test this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The new Video and Audio blocks are geared towards inserting files that have already been uploaded to the media library. However, I found the text on the video block to be confusing. If I was new to WordPress and didn&#8217;t understand how oEmbed works, I would be clicking inside the video block to figure out where to paste the URL.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/video-block.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The new Audio and Video blocks mirror the same kind of functionality that users have experienced when adding images to their sites. In the future, contributors may introduce more features to the audio block, such as additional playback types and looping, but the first iteration includes just the basics.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 0.8.0 adds resizing handlers to the existing Image Block, making it easy for users to insert and quickly resize an image. If you review the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2213\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub ticket</a> for this feature, it&#8217;s clear that it was not easy to implement. Image resizing has gone through several changes and may have more down the road, especially as it pertains to the behavior of the caption. Ultimately, the caption field should not be wider than the image so that the two are placed together.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/image-resizing-gutenberg.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release introduces a post formats selector to the post settings sidebar. It includes a suggestion based on what blocks are in use in the post. One participant on the ticket noted that the suggestion gives too much importance to the post formats selection and might be confusing to users. The suggestion persists, despite a user switching the format to the one suggested. This is because Gutenberg cannot detect if it was explicitly set by the user or if the user selected the suggestion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I happen to agree with you: post formats should go away,&#8221; Joen Asmussen <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2307#issuecomment-321232074\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;In fact part of the genesis of blocks as a concept is to provide a better interface than what post formats did. So the post format selector here is strictly a back-compat thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/post-format-selector.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg contributors have also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2288\" target=\"_blank\">updated</a> the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/master/docs/design.md\" target=\"_blank\">design document</a> for the project, offering more clarity on their goals and concepts they are using to build the editor:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ultimately, the vision for Gutenberg is to make it much easier to author rich content. Through ensuring good defaults, wrapping and bundling advanced layout options blocks, and making the most important actions immediately available, authoring content with WordPress should be accessible to anyone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The idea is to simplify content creation for users so that they only have to learn one interface &#8211; the block interface. The design document adds several new sections that elaborate on the concept of &#8220;everything is a block&#8221; and includes best practices that developers can reference when designing their own blocks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 22:18:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"WPTavern: Early Results from NRKbetaâ€™s Comment Quiz Plugin Show Readers Enjoy the Quiz but Rarely Leave a Comment\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74105\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:123:\"https://wptavern.com/early-results-from-nrkbetas-comment-quiz-plugin-show-readers-enjoy-the-quiz-but-rarely-leave-a-comment\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3514:\"<p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://nrkbeta.no/\" target=\"_blank\">NRKbeta</a>, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporationâ€™s media and technology site, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/nrkbeta-open-sources-comment-quiz-plugin-for-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">open sourced its comment quiz plugin for WordPress</a>. The site&#8217;s publishers have been experimenting with requiring their readers to complete a short, three-question quiz before giving access to the comment form on certain articles. The goal of the plugin was to prevent rants and off-topic responses by ensuring that commenters have read the article.</p>\n<p>NRKbeta has <a href=\"https://nrkbeta.no/2017/08/10/with-a-quiz-to-comment-readers-test-their-article-comprehension/\" target=\"_blank\">published some preliminary results</a> after six months of experimenting with a mandatory quiz before commenting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On average, there are a lot more attempts â€“ both correct and wrong â€“ than actual comments,&#8221; NRKbeta journalist StÃ¥le Grut said. &#8220;It seems many take the quiz to check how much they remember from the story â€“ and not necessarily to leave a comment. Almost as a fun little game after reading.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nkrbeta-comments.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Grut reported that on average the quiz has an error rate of 72%. His team suspects that the bulk of the wrong answers are coming site&#8217;s international readership, as most of the articles are posted in Norwegian, which can be difficult to translate.</p>\n<p>The sample is still relatively small, because the team hasn&#8217;t yet created any set rules for when authors should enable the quiz.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea was to test it on stories that had potential for a gloomy comments section,&#8221; Grut said. &#8220;It is something we are proud to rarely have here at NRKbeta.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On one story, NRKbeta staff made an error where it was impossible to submit the correct answer to the quiz, because it wasn&#8217;t listed. As a result, this article&#8217;s quiz received more than 1,000 wrong answers.</p>\n<p>One unexpected benefit of the plugin is that it makes it more of a hurdle for readers to leave short comments, such as &#8220;nice post&#8221; that don&#8217;t add much to the conversation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This favors the most eager with the most time on their hands,&#8221; Grut said. &#8220;From time to time this has led to a decline in quality and tone, causing him to often abandon the quiz module.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These initial conclusions are in line with what we predicted when the plugin was released: the most motivated ranters are not significantly inconvenienced by a short quiz. Keeping comment sections free of trolls is not yet something that is easy to automate. It still requires time spent in the moderation queue.</p>\n<p>After the comment quiz plugin was enabled on the site, NRKbeta counted more than 300 articles around the web that had been published about the experiment.

Most law professors were, and still are, publishing blogs on <a href=\"http://www.typepad.com/\">TypePad</a>, an outdated and little used publishing software, originally produced by Six Apart.</p>\n<p>Today, WordPress is running almost 70 percent of the content management systems in the world. WordPress is regularly updated and enables a multi-user platform with multiple individual sites, all of which would be needed by a law schoolâ€™s &#8216;printing press&#8217;.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Glutenberg Free</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/glutenburg-free/\">Gluternberg Free</a> is a WordPress plugin developed by Adam Silverstein that restores and maintains the post editing experience from WordPress 4.8.</p>\n<h2>Open Source Candy Bar Labels for WordCamps</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re organizing a WordCamp and want to give out Happiness bars, check out this <a href=\"https://github.com/dimensionmedia/WordCamp-Happiness-Bars\">custom label design</a> used at WordCamp Miami 2016.

Blog posts are easier to archive and link to, are not lost in the noise as quickly, and are a better user experience for consuming content.</p>\n<p>By the way, if you&#8217;ve already threaded a message on Twitter, Rush shares links to tools that can help capture a thread and turn it into a blog post.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.customerservant.com/next-time-youre-thinking-threading-twitter-write-blog-post-instead/\">The Next Time You&#8217;re Thinking About Threading On Twitter, Write A Blog Post Instead</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Story of HelloSales</h2>\n<p>iThemes published a <a href=\"https://ithemes.com/2017/08/10/story-of-our-newest-ithemes-product-hellosales/\">detailed article</a> on how their newest product, <a href=\"https://ithemes.com/hellosales\">HelloSales</a>, came to be. Cory Miller explains the product&#8217;s logo, name, and who the people are that are building it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The rooster is essentially the symbol or emblem of Portugal. Youâ€™ll see it everywhere there when you go there (and I strongly encourage you to do so, even if I want to keep the place all to myself).</p>\n<p>It became obvious we wanted to include a rooster in the logo of HelloSales as a hat tip to Portugal and our team there. We also think itâ€™s a great symbol for what we hope to help our customers do â€” make more money through their WooCommerce stores.</p>\n<p>Through several iterations of a name, we landed on HelloSales as a name, as yet another hat tip to the story â€” their companyâ€™s name, HelloDev â€” that led us here.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s a cool story and one I&#8217;d like to see more CEO and founders share when they acquire a product or business.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Telemetry Part Two</h2>\n<p>Morten Rand-Hendriksen <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-telemetry-wordpress-morten-rand-hendriksen\">updated his article</a> on the case for WordPress telemetry after a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/895299336375902209\">lengthy conversation</a> on Twitter.</p>\n<blockquote><p>What WordPress needs is an open debate on this topic. What are the arguments for and against? What can be gained and what is lost? Should we do this? And if so, how do we do it in an open, transparent, and responsible way that helps inform and elevate the conversation while looking after the interests of <em>all</em> WordPress users?</p></blockquote>\n<p>These are interesting questions and although the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38418\">ticket</a><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38418\"> is closed</a> on Trac, users are encouraged to continue the discussion.

The development cycle kicked off in early August with Beta 1 scheduled for early October and the official release targeted for November 14.</p>\n<p>Choyce published a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/\" target=\"_blank\">list of goals</a> today that outlines what they will be aiming for in 4.9. WordPress users can expect to see some existing features polished up to be more user-friendly, including some long-awaited updates to the experience of editing theme and plugin files in the admin.</p>\n<p>Contributors are looking at <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6531\" target=\"_blank\">adding a nested folder structure</a> that will offer access to files deeper than two levels. They are also aiming to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31779\" target=\"_blank\">add better warnings</a> for users who are editing themes and plugins, an improvement which Choyce described as &#8220;graduating from cowboy coding school.&#8221; This could help prevent users from unknowingly making small errors that could have a negative impact on their sites.</p>\n<p>Another goal for 4.9 is to improve the code editing experience by adding syntax highlighting. Contributors are examining the possibility of incorporating CodeMirror functionality into the Customizer&#8217;s custom CSS box as well as the plugin and theme file editors. An experimental <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/codemirror-wp\" target=\"_blank\">Syntax Highlighting Code Editor for WordPress Core</a> plugin is currently being developed on GitHub as a potential solution for a seven-year-old trac <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> for code editor improvements.</p>\n<p>Customizer improvements are also one of the main focuses for 4.9. Contributors to the Customize Snapshots feature plugin have been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/customize-snapshots-0-6-0-adds-the-ability-to-name-and-merge-changesets\" target=\"_blank\">steadily refining</a> the ability to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896\" target=\"_blank\">draft</a> and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28721\" target=\"_blank\">schedule</a> changesets in the Customizer. They are also looking at providing a better experience for <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39693\" target=\"_blank\">widget</a> and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39692\" target=\"_blank\">menu mapping</a> when switching between themes, improving homepage settings (&#8220;<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16379\" target=\"_blank\">Page on Front</a>&#8220;), and displaying responsive images in the Customizer sidebar.</p>\n<p>This list of goals for 4.9 includes many more items and the release leads are approaching it with the understanding that some features and improvements may not be ready in time. One item on the list is getting in <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Core+REST+API+Task%22\" target=\"_blank\">API endpoints that Gutenberg requires</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to WordPress 5.0, new Gutenberg design lead Tammie Lister has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/\" target=\"_blank\">proposed a revised, tentative roadmap</a> that anticipates having the new editor ready for a merge proposal in December 2017. Lister said the outline is not set in stone and Gutenberg&#8217;s path to 5.0 would be dependent on the success of the merge proposal.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 19:19:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:127:\"WPTavern: WordPress.comâ€™s Business Plan Gives Subscribers a Way to Tap into WordPress.orgâ€™s Third-party Ecosystem\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74048\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:122:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-coms-business-plan-gives-subscribers-a-way-to-tap-into-wordpress-orgs-third-party-ecosystem\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8448:\"<p>Earlier this year, WordPress.com <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-experiments-with-allowing-business-plan-customers-to-install-third-party-plugins-and-themes\">launched an experiment</a> giving <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/business/\">Business plan subscribers</a> the ability to install third-party plugins and themes. Automattic<a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/08/07/wordpress-com-business-now-supports-plugins-and-third-party-themes/\"> concluded the experiment</a> earlier this week and officially made the features part of the subscription plan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With support for plugins and third-party themes, WordPress.com Business users will be able to connect their sites to great email and social media tools, e-commerce solutions, publishing and subscription services, and more,&#8221; Mark Armstrong said.</p>\n<p>This change is twelve years in the making. With the exception of WordPress VIP, customers have not had the ability to install third-party themes and plugins on WordPress.com.</p>\n<h2>Customers Can Only Install Custom Plugins Through The WP-Admin Interface</h2>\n<p>Customers can install plugins or themes from the WordPress.org directories or they can upload custom themes and plugins. WordPress.com has two user interfaces, one that resembles Calypso and the other is WP-Admin.</p>\n<p>Here is what adding plugins looks like using the Calypso interface. Plugins are displayed from the WordPress.org plugin directory with no way to upload a custom plugin.</p>\n<img />Adding Plugins on WordPress.com Through The Calypso Interface\n<p>This is what adding plugins looks like using the WP-Admin interface. This interface has a button that allows customers to upload a custom plugin. Automattic is aware of the discrepancy and says they&#8217;re working on streamlining both interfaces.</p>\n<img />Adding Plugins Through WP-Admin on WordPress.com\n<h2>Customers Can Upload Non 100% GPL Licensed Code to WordPress.com</h2>\n<p>The ability to upload a custom theme or plugin truly opens the door for subscribers to customize their sites. But it also allows customers to use themes and plugins that are not 100% GPL licensed. Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Automattic, has <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/themes-are-gpl-too/\">made it clear</a> in the past that he will only support plugins and themes that are 100% GPL.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even though graphics and CSS arenâ€™t <em>required</em> to be GPL legally, the lack thereof is pretty limiting. Can you imagine WordPress without any CSS or JavaScript? So as before, we will only promote and host things on WordPress.org that are 100% GPL <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility\">or compatible</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg has used his <a href=\"http://designcrumbs.com/automatically-blackballed\">influence in the past</a> to provoke marketplaces such as Envato to provide a 100% GPL license option to its authors. Authors who choose not to sell their items with the 100% GPL license are excluded from being able to sponsor or speak at WordCamps.</p>\n<p>Although the above quote references WordPress.org, WordPress.com is a platform that Mullenweg controls. It&#8217;s odd that the ability to upload a theme or plugin that is not 100% GPL exists on WordPress.com. I believe the feature is an oversight and will be removed in the immediate future ensuring that only themes and plugins from the official directories are allowed to be used.</p>\n<h2>Managed WordPress Hosts Have Reasons to Be Concerned</h2>\n<p>Responses to the news from members of the WordPress community are mixed. Phil Crumm, Director of Strategic Opportunities at 10up, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@philcrumm/the-curious-conundrum-of-the-new-wordpress-com-business-plan-b0044ad57acd\">published a great article</a> that examines the potential impacts this move will have on the managed WordPress hosting ecosystem and its community:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"8b34\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Within the WordPress community, thereâ€™s long been a notion that &#8216;more users on WordPress&#8217; is universally good. Until now, thatâ€™s been difficult to argue: an expansive ecosystem has developed over the last decade, and many now make their living off of WordPress.</p>\n<p id=\"2813\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Despite that, WordPress.comâ€™s Business Plan now feels like itâ€™s oriented towards cannibalizing users from elsewhere within that ecosystemâ€Šâ€”â€Šfrom sites that may have &#8216;grown up&#8217; and moved to another hosting provider to those that now may not know that the broader ecosystem even existsâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhich is objectively a step backwards for the WordPress community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://perezbox.com/\">Tony Perez</a>, co-founder and CEO of Sucuri, says the <a href=\"https://perezbox.com/2017/08/automattics-push-managed-wordpress-potential-impacts-hosting-ecosystem/\">implications are gravest</a> to managed WordPress hosts. &#8220;The biggest impacts however are likely to be towards those hosting companies that have invested resources (both people and dollars) into creating a vibrant Managed WordPress hosting business ecosystem,&#8221; Perez said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Long are the days when the market was defined by Page.ly and WPEngine. Today I would consider the space to be saturated, with more flavors of Managed WordPress than ice cream at a Baskin-Robbins.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://chrislema.com/\">Chris Lema</a>, a member of Liquid Web&#8217;s Leadership team, <a href=\"https://perezbox.com/2017/08/automattics-push-managed-wordpress-potential-impacts-hosting-ecosystem/#comment-3456606874\">responded to the article</a> saying it&#8217;s rare for manufactures to enter the same market as their distributors or partners.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While not impossible, we rarely see manufacturers get into the same business as their distributors or retail partners,&#8221; Lema said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because it can create a lot of unwanted, unplanned for, unintended secondary consequences. But to inexpensive hosts, this is one of those head-turners, because they were assured, for oh so long, that this wasn&#8217;t the game Automattic was getting into.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But Automattic is not just a nice community player. They&#8217;re a business. With investors. And they have to think about their own bottom line. So while it&#8217;s not surprising, I think you&#8217;re right that hosts have the most to be thinking about.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Others like Scott Bolinger, have expressed cautious optimism regarding the change.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">3rd party plugins and themes can now be used on <a href=\"https://t.co/eNa4NCrrPO\">https://t.co/eNa4NCrrPO</a>. This is great news, although how great remains to be seen. <a href=\"https://t.co/TntfJJ9sLD\">https://t.co/TntfJJ9sLD</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Scott Bolinger (@scottbolinger) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottbolinger/status/894627296648114176\">August 7, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some theme and plugin authors see it as a growth opportunity. Josh Pollock, founder of <a href=\"https://calderaforms.com/\">CalderaWP,</a>Â is excited to see WordPress.com become a quality hosting option for his users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a plugin author, I like not just more places for my plug-in to be used, but more quality hosting options,&#8221; Pollock said. &#8220;Dealing with sub-optimal environments is the hardest part of being a plug-in author. I&#8217;m excited about more users and having those users be on a quality platform.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>How Much Pie Does Automattic Want?</h2>\n<p>WordPress.com offering a subset of customers the ability to access the incredible third-party WordPress plugin and theme ecosystem is a huge development, but it leaves me with a few questions.

The data collection included in last week&#8217;s release reignited the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38418\" target=\"_blank\">discussion regarding adding telemetry to WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>James Nylen and an Automattic engineers involved in Gutenberg added the feature with the goal of improving the editor based on usage patterns. Nylen said the approach they used was very similar to Calypso&#8217;s event tracking code and that it would provide &#8220;a very useful technique to collect user experience data.&#8221; They had planned to use the data to inform various decisions, such as default order for blocks and whether some blocks are less suitable for core. Gutenberg contributors were looking into making the tracking its own module so it could be useful for other WP feature plugins and core.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the feature was added to Gutenberg, contributors began to revisit the Telemetry discussion on WordPress Trac. The topic of telemetry for core had been tabled earlier this year, as it did not fall within the three core focus areas for WordPress development in 2017. Participants requested the ticket be reopened for discussion looking toward 2018 in light of Gutenberg adding opt-in tracking.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a terrible idea for Gutenberg, too,&#8221; Matt Mullenweg commented on the ticket. &#8220;I doubt that anything actionable or useful will come of it that couldn&#8217;t be obtained by non-data-collecting means.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Twelve hours later, James Nylen <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/06/opt-in-usage-tracking-in-gutenberg/#comment-32882\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on his original announcement to notify the community that tracking will be removed from Gutenberg in the 0.8.0 release:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Thereâ€™s been quite a lot of discussion on this topic across the community, much of which stems from earlier discussions like <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38418\" target=\"_blank\">#38418</a>, which I wasnâ€™t aware of.</p>\n<p>Usage tracking in Core and feature projects is a much bigger topic than fits into the scope of Gutenberg right now, so Iâ€™ve removed it from the GitHub repo, and it will be removed in the 0.8 Gutenberg release.</p>\n<p>The data that it was tracking, while interesting, probably wouldnâ€™t have been a significant factor in the long-term growth and development of Gutenberg. The discussion surrounding the data collection, however, would take up a disproportionate amount of the teamâ€™s time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nylen said the data collected by the plugin thus far will be deleted after 0.8 rolls out and that since it&#8217;s so early in Gutenberg&#8217;s development there was &#8220;not enough data collected to provide any sort of picture of usage.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress Telemetry Advocates Continue Lobbying for Opt-In Data Collection</h3>\n<p>The discussion about whether or not WordPress needs telemetry has continued in the form of tweetstorms, as data collection advocates make the case for data-driven decision making.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The decision not to capture metrics (telemetry) from WordPress is one that continues to have a large impact on what we (don&#8217;t) know,&#8221; Liquid Web VP of Product Chris Lema <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrislema/status/895136427977068544\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;As we&#8217;re trying to make decisions about Gutenberg and metaboxes, we might ask, how big a problem is this, by number of plugins or sites. But we don&#8217;t know because we decided that we can always iterate WordPress, like we&#8217;ve always done. It&#8217;s true that we&#8217;ve done that before, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s either the wisest approach, nor the least risky. With so many options today, will people necessarily return? The more logical approach, in my mind, is to capture as much data as possible and to make it as public as possible, so we can all review.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If the problem were lack of data, we could easily produce terabytes per day.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/895506034533453825\">August 10, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">seconded with the power of 1000 suns</p>\n<p>&mdash; joe guilmette <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f1f9-1f1ed.png\" alt=\"ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@travlbum) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/travlbum/status/895539950933782528\">August 10, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mor10.com/the-case-for-wordpress-telemetry/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Telemetry proposal</a> author Morten Rand-Hendriksen joined in the discussion with another <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/895299336375902209\" target=\"_blank\">tweetstorm</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress needs a core method for collecting quantitative user data through telemetry (metrics). One of the biggest challenges WordPress faces is the lack of reliable data about global day-to-day use. Like most Open Source projects, WordPress has relied on community feedback as its primary data source, which is fine for a small project. The problem is WordPress is a Very Big Project with global reach and the majority of its users never interface with the community. </p>\n<p>I like to say we, the people who talk about, provide feedback for, and design/develop WordPress are the 1%. It might be more like 0.1%. Making decisions based on the traditional community feedback model is making decisions without knowing anything about the majority of users. Some will argue this is fine, that WordPress is developed by those who show up. That&#8217;s not a workable or responsible model for a project. We, the people who build WordPress, have a duty of care to the people we build it for. And those people are not us. &#8216;We can just do user testing,&#8217; you say? Sure. Let&#8217;s do proper qualitative user testing. That requires staffing, funding, and infrastructure. User testing for a project like WordPress is non-trivial. It requires professional analysis.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Rand-Hendriksen&#8217;s tweetstorm continued with a summary of his telemetry proposal which would be opt-in based on a plugin prompted from core. The plugin would anonymize all collected data and allow for targeted data collection based on research needs. He proposes that the data be stored on servers owned by the community, separate from corporate interests, so the data can be shared openly to ensure transparency. The <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38418\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> for this feature request is currently closed.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This discussion belongs in Trac in an open ticket. Closing it down because one person disagrees is not the Open Source way.</p>\n<p>&mdash; MortenRandHendriksen (@mor10) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/895307240122368001\">August 9, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;Thereâ€™s a ton going on, and itâ€™s far more important than built-in big brother centralized tracking,&#8221; Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/895678580935491588\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in response to Rand-Hendriksen&#8217;s tweetstorm. &#8220;Do it as a plugin or with a host and show it informs a decision that we wouldnâ€™t have taken otherwise. And remember that past usage is not a good predictor of future success, or what the world needs. We need to build iPhones not Blackberries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle\" target=\"_blank\">2016 State of the Word</a> address, Mullenweg proposed a new structure for core releases in 2017 where he would be putting on the &#8216;product lead&#8217; hat and have design and user testing lead the way. As feature requests have popped up outside of the three core focus areas, Mullenweg has had to systematically shut them down or put them on hold for later in order to keep Gutenberg on track.</p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s not surprising that the engineers leading the Gutenberg project, most of whom are employed by Automattic, wouldn&#8217;t think twice about adding user tracking. The company has <a href=\"https://data.blog/\" target=\"_blank\">a blog entirely devoted to data</a> where its data scientists write about the data pipelines they have built to help the company create a sustainable business. Historically, Automattic has strongly embraced using data in making decisions, which is why Calypso has event tracking built into it. Mullenweg is taking a different product leadership approach with the open source WordPress project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For people unhappy with our direction, no amount of data will change their minds,&#8221; Mullenweg said in response to critics on Twitter. &#8220;The results will tell. Iâ€™m happy to stand by them the past 14 years, and believe the next 14 will validate our approach.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 02:08:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Forks select2, Releases selectWoo as a Drop-In Replacement with Improved Accessibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73999\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-forks-select2-releases-selectwoo-as-a-drop-in-replacement-with-improved-accessibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4165:\"<p>The WooCommerce development team has <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/08/08/selectwoo-an-accessible-replacement-for-select2/\" target=\"_blank\">forked select2</a> to create a more accessible, drop-in replacement library called selectWoo. <a href=\"https://select2.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">select2</a> is a widely used jQuery-based library for making custom drop down menus. Many users are wondering if the project has been abandoned, because the repository hasn&#8217;t seen any activity since February and 115 pull requests have piled up.</p>\n<p>In the interest of fixing some long-standing accessibility issues with the library, WooCommerce opted to fork it and has merged in some of the PRs that were submitted to the original project. SelectWoo is backwards-compatible and can be used the same way as select2 by simply replacing the select2.js file. It has been optimized for WordPress plugin development and can optionally be initialized with .selectWoo() in order to run alongside other versions of select2 that may be used by other plugins on the site.</p>\n<p>SelectWoo makes many improvements for those who are using screen readers, but it needs more accessibility testing. <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/selectWoo/releases/tag/woo-1.0.0-beta.1\" target=\"_blank\">Beta 1</a> is availabe on GitHub. The WooCommerce team has even created a <a href=\"https://woocommerce.github.io/selectWoo/accessibility-testing/\" target=\"_blank\">testing page</a> with different example pages so those using screen-reading software can easily test for bugs.</p>\n<p>Forking is usually a last resort scenario for extending popular open source libraries, but the WooCommerce team wanted the flexibility of improving the project on their own timeline. One concerned developer asked the team what will happen in the future if select2 gets back on track and why they didn&#8217;t just submit pull requests to the select2 repository.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With a fork we can at least get things merged in to meet our own schedule, rather than waiting/relying on others or running custom versions,&#8221; WooCommerce lead developer Mike Jolley said. &#8220;There are other benefits, too, such as allowing our version to be namespaced to avoid conflicts in WP admin. The fork is public. Our changes can be merged back, when/if the project picks up again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Both WordPress and Drupal core contributors have been working to <a href=\"https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/3744\" target=\"_blank\">address accessibility issues in select2</a> since 2015 when the WP Accessibility Team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2015/09/07/accessibility-usertest-select2/\" target=\"_blank\">performed extensive testing on the library</a> to see if it was fit for use in core. Some initial planning work happened but work on these issues stalled out as select2&#8217;s maintainers became unavailable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d do it with PRs if I thought they would get merged in, but I doubt they will,&#8221; WooCommerce developer Claudiu Lodromanean <a href=\"https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/3744#issuecomment-320464534\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;There&#8217;s been no action in this repo in about six months and the fork contains some PRs that have been waiting to get merged here for a very long time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Forking a project can needlessly fragment its contributors by causing them to have to choose one or the other, especially as the projects diverge down the line. Motivated contributors may submit multiple PRs across both projects for improvements but most will simply contribute back to the project they use. Select2&#8217;s maintainers have not published any news about why the project has gone dormant.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are <a href=\"https://github.com/select2/select2/pulls\" target=\"_blank\">over 100 PRs in the select2 repo</a> unmerged,&#8221; Jolley said in response to commenters asking about the necessity of the fork. &#8220;Some of these we actually need, so with the fork weâ€™re free to merge these as needed. The accessibility issues are hurting users today, so we cannot really afford to wait.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 03:54:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 284 â€“ Catching Up with David Peralty\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=74024&preview=true&preview_id=74024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-284-catching-up-with-david-peralty\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2872:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"https://jjj.blog/\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://peralty.com/\">David Peralty</a>.

The program targets communities in Latin and South America, Africa, Oceania, and Asia.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Specifically, we want to shine more light on the potential of open source software in countries where there is less participation in OSS projects,&#8221; WordPress Community Team leader Andrea Middleton said. &#8220;To help spread the word about the potential that open source has to offer, weâ€™d like to provide financial support for two educational events this year, to be organized in parts of the world with less participation in open source.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After the success of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-incubator-program-to-launch-in-indonesia-zimbabwe-and-columbia\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Incubator Program</a>, which brought three new camps to Indonesia, Zimbabwe, and Colombia, there is some evidence that initiatives to bring WordPress to other parts of the world can have valuable returns. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/harare-zimbabwe-to-host-its-2nd-wordcamp-november-4-2017\" target=\"_blank\">Harare is hosting its second WordCamp</a> in November and the local meetup group has nearly doubled over the past year. The other camps had similarly successful events and growth in meetup numbers.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Harare organizer Thabo Tswana said that one of the biggest impacts that the first WordCamp had was to introduce local attendees to the WordPress community. WordPress software is well-known across the world but many do not know that there is a strong community behind the project that they can connect with.</p>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation is looking for organizers to host &#8220;Introduction to Open Source&#8221; events that will be structured as two-hour workshops using <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/user-lessons/what-is-open-source/\" target=\"_blank\">training</a> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/user-lessons/what-can-you-do-with-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">materials</a> available in the WordPress handbook. The goal is to introduce attendees to the world of open source software, the GPL license, and how it is important for WordPress as an open source project.</p>\n<p>The Foundation is subsidizing the events (up to $500) so they will be free for anyone to attend. A <a href=\"http://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/open-source-training-organizer-application\" target=\"_blank\">10-question application</a> is open for those who want to organize an event in 2017. The call for organizers says that preference will be given to organizers who are already members of a group that is part of WordPress&#8217; meetup chapter program and areas where no WordCamp has previously been organized. Applications close August 21 and successful applicants will be notified by September 8.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Aug 2017 19:19:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"Post Status: Publish Conference, in pictures\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=38424\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://poststatus.com/publish-conference-pictures/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34326:\"<p>Pictures from <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/publish\">Post Status Publish</a> were almost all taken by <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/people/brian-richards/\">Brian Richards</a>, unless they are pictures of Brian Richards.

Quote: Thanks to the WordPress meetup, I found focus, fun, friends, and what passes for fame.\" /><p>I did not spend my childhood wanting to grow up to be a WordPress consultant. Given that I was born in 1967, long before the World Wide Web even existed, I would have had to be clairvoyant to aspire to any kind of web development. I was intrigued by computers when I first encountered the TRS-80 at the age of 12, but other than learning a few lines of BASIC, I didnâ€™t pursue programming.</p>\n<p>Parenthetically, I donâ€™t think it was because girls werenâ€™t encouraged to become programmers. This was even before the days of the Control Data Institute commercials on TV. Programming as a career for anyone at all was not in the minds of the general public, at least not in Ohio. And although I thought computers were cool (being a science fiction fan and all), I didnâ€™t have any clear sense of what you could do with them. I never made the mental connection between writing a 10-line program in BASIC and eventually creating something like a video game or a word-processing program.</p>\n<p>During my freshman year in college, I fell into the Classics Vortex, and ended up going to graduate school to study Greek and Latin drama. I expected to get my degree and a university teaching job.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I spoke at a few conferences and published a few papers. And I discovered the World Wide Web.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Iâ€™d gotten online in 1985, also in my freshman year at Brown. We were on BITNET and someone in the computer center showed me how to get onto Relay when I was down their using the mainframe to write essays with. (Fly, sledgehammer, boom.) The Internet came into being about the time I got to graduate school in 1989, and someone showed me the Web in 1994. It blew me away, because a visual medium of communication is vastly superior to a text-based medium when youâ€™re talking about theatrical productions.</p>\n<p>By the end of 1994 Iâ€™d moved to England and created my first web page. (We didnâ€™t have websites in those days, just â€˜pages.â€™ Even if there were lots of pages. And wow, I just wrote that in inverted commas rather than quotation marks, as if my brain shifted itself back to Britain just thinking about it.)</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DIDASKALIA-1998-min.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2017\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DIDASKALIA-1998-min-1024x506.png\" alt=\"Sallieâ€™s first website, Didaskalia, as it was in 1998\" width=\"960\" height=\"474\" /></a>Sallieâ€™s first website, Didaskalia, as it was in 1998\n<p>So youâ€™d think that maybe, from there, I would have gotten into a career in web development whether or not WordPress had ever existed, but that wasnâ€™t what actually happened.</p>\n<h3>When Your Body Isn&#8217;t Your Friend</h3>\n<p>While I was still in graduate school, I developed a debilitating chronic illness that prevented me from finishing my PhD due to a combination of physical and cognitive problems, and although I started to get better at first, by the end of 1998, when I had to return to the US, my condition had worsened to the point where I wasnâ€™t sure Iâ€™d ever be able to work. I spent about 18 months just going to doctors and therapists and support groups. When I did start working, it was as a caregiver, doing extremely simple tasks, because my confidence in my ability to do knowledge work of any kind was so badly damaged.</p>\n<p>I eventually started doing more kinds of things to earn money: clerical work, basic tech support, writing. Somewhere in there, I helped a couple of people with their websites, even though Iâ€™d missed a whole lot of the evolution of the Web. (Iâ€™m not at all sorry to have skipped Flash.) I was feeling considerably better thanks to new medication, and easing my way toward being self-supporting, but at the time I discovered WordPress in 2005, I was suffering from a bad case of Multiple Business Personality Disorder. I had a number of useful skills, but no clear focus or unifying principle.</p>\n<p>I had started my first blog on Blogger in January 2005, but within a few months I found myself hanging out with a lot of podcasters, and almost all of them used WordPress because the PodPress plugin (RIP) made it so easy to publish feeds with enclosures. I started to explore WordPress further, and within a few years had migrated my blog from Blogger because they stopped allowing you to self-host your blog. WordPress had meanwhile introduced pages, making it possible to build an entire website rather than having an HTML website and a WordPress blog.</p>\n<h3>Finding Community</h3>\n<p>But WordPress would probably have remained a sideline if I hadnâ€™t started going to WordPress meetups. I was at a podcasting meetup in San Francisco in late 2008 when someone mentioned a WordPress meetup in SF. I went to a meeting (I think in January 2009) and someone THERE mentioned that there was a WordPress meetup starting in the East Bay, closer to where I lived. I went to that meeting in February 2009â€¦and the rest is history.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It wasnâ€™t that the first meetup was such an amazing experience. The organizer was new at running a meetup and we were all strangers to each other. But somehow talking about our shared interest in WordPress just made us more interested.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Iâ€™ve always been a service junkie, and Iâ€™d been involved with other networking groups for years, so it wasnâ€™t long before I found myself co-organizer, helping to plan and run the meetup and welcoming new members as they joined. Through the meetup, I started to learn more about the WordPress community and open source software. A group of us went to WordCamp SF 2009.</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/WordCampSF-2010-min.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2019\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/WordCampSF-2010-min.jpg\" alt=\"East Bay WordPress Meetup members at WCSF 2010\" width=\"1776\" height=\"2336\" /></a>East Bay WordPress Meetup members at WCSF 2010\n<p>Because of the meetup, I made more and more connections in the wider WordPress community. Because of the meetup, I learned a lot more about WordPress than I would have on my own, in part because I often had to teach it. Because of the meetup, more WordPress-related work came to me. I started to learn more code, little bits and fragments at a time. WordPress drew me in deeper and deeper as time progressed. In 2012, I officially registered WP Fangirl, and since that time, almost all my income has come from WordPress work.</p>\n<h3>All the WordCamps</h3>\n<p>I went to all the San Francisco WordCamps between 2009 and 2014, after which WordCamp US was instituted. By the time the first WordCamp Sacramento was announced in 2015, all the meetup presentations Iâ€™d done gave me the confidence to submit a talk. It was accepted. Iâ€™ve since spoken at WCLAX 2016 and WCSAC 2016. Iâ€™m working on my presentation for WCSAC 2017. (Iâ€™d love to travel for more meetups, but itâ€™s not in the budget.)</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Sallie_Goetsch-min.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2021\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Sallie_Goetsch-min.jpg\" alt=\"Speaking at WordCamp LAX 2016\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1086\" /></a>Speaking at WordCamp LAX 2016\n<p>The experience I had with the Meetup made me want to connect more and more with other WordPress people, and to help out where I could. As I said, Iâ€™m a service junkie, so I readily embraced the idea of giving back to the community. Iâ€™m not a good enough developer (yet, anyway) to be a core contributor, but there are lots of ways to contribute. The main one, in my case, is organizing the meetup, though it took me until 2016 to join the official WordPress Community meetup program.</p>\n<p>I was also very active in the main WordPress LinkedIn group for several years, which led to Oâ€™Reilly hiring me as the technical reviewer for WordPress: The Missing Manual. (It may also have contributed to the gig I had in 2011 making WordPress videos for Peachpit Press and the one in 2012 and 2013 teaching WordPress for Mediabistro.)</p>\n<p>I started listening to WordPress podcasts in about 2006, though WP Weekly is the only one of those early shows thatâ€™s still around. There are tons of new WP podcasts now, more than I can keep up with. I got invited to participate in one, the WP-Tonic panel, starting in 2015. You can hear me being mouthy and opinionated there almost every week. I follow WordPress people on Twitter, belong to WordPress Slack teams, and have been known to dream about WordPress.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the WordPress meetup, I found focus, fun, friends, and what passes for fame. Iâ€™m still working on fortune, but I can tell you that the secret to the many great referrals Iâ€™ve gotten from my extensive network of WordPress connections is this: donâ€™t go into it looking for what you can get. Just concentrate on what you can give, and never stop learning.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: WordPress Ate My Lifeâ€”In a Good Way\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=WordPress%20Ate%20My%20Life%E2%80%94In%20a%20Good%20Way&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-ate-life-good-way%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: WordPress Ate My Lifeâ€”In a Good Way\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-ate-life-good-way%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-ate-life-good-way%2F&title=WordPress+Ate+My+Life%E2%80%94In+a+Good+Way\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: WordPress Ate My Lifeâ€”In a Good Way\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-ate-life-good-way/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/080917-min-150x150.jpg&description=WordPress Ate My Lifeâ€”In a Good Way\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: WordPress Ate My Lifeâ€”In a Good Way\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-ate-life-good-way/\" title=\"WordPress Ate My Lifeâ€”In a Good Way\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-ate-life-good-way/\">WordPress Ate My Lifeâ€”In a Good Way</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Aug 2017 12:00:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Sallie Goetsch\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"Post Status: Live from Publish: Challenges facing the WordPress Economy â€” Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=38415\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"https://poststatus.com/live-publish-challenges-facing-wordpress-economy-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1739:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

The team is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952#issuecomment-320644682\">considering various solutions</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952#issuecomment-320638392\">some </a>have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottkclark/status/894488147966517248\">suggested</a> that a Fields API in core would have made the future of meta boxes less of an issue.</p>\n<p>I reached out to <a href=\"https://www.scottkclark.com/\">Scott Kingsley Clark</a>, lead developer ofÂ the <a title=\"Pods Framework for WordPress\" href=\"http://pods.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pods Framework</a> and one of the main contributors to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/fields-api/\">Fields API project</a>. Clark explains what the Fields API is, its current status, its relationship to the meta box discussions, and how to contribute.</p>\n<p><strong>For those who don&#8217;t know, what is the Fields API project? How would it impact users?</strong></p>\n<p>Itâ€™s a <a href=\"https://github.com/sc0ttkclark/wordpress-fields-api\">feature proposal</a> for WordPress core to allow registering fields to different screens in the admin area through a single API. For posts, this would add new meta boxes and fields within them. For users, it would add new sections and fields to the profile screen. The goal is to integrate with all of the different admin screens including, Posts, Terms, Users, Media, and Comments.</p>\n<p>Typical users would notice that the fields added by plugins they are using all have a similar look and feel. Thatâ€™s really an oversimplification of whatâ€™s going on behind the scenes, but itâ€™s one of the big benefits as well, since it shouldnâ€™t really affect end-users beyond improving consistency of different screens and potential redesigns.</p>\n<p><strong>What has caused progress on the project to slow down?</strong></p>\n<p>I was out-of-town for a all-hands company meetup, lead organized WordCamp Dallas-Fort Worth 2016, and ran PodsCamp 2016 in Austin, TX, all in the span of about a month and a half. It was intense, but somehow last summer I thought I could manage moving too.</p>\n<p>We were in the process of showing our house, almost all of the time, so that we could sell it. The buying process was full of thorns, with a move that was pretty fun. I also started a new job at Modern Tribe in February, 2017.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, yes that was way too much but the challenge was met and the only thing that suffered was the Fields API project, which was no easy feat. Itâ€™s unfortunate, but Iâ€™m glad to be getting back into things again this month.</p>\n<p><strong>Are new contributors showing a renewed interest in the project?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. We recently had a few people become interested in helping. When Iâ€™ve got help, Iâ€™m 300% more productive. Itâ€™s much easier to bounce ideas off of others with shared experience than it is going alone.</p>\n<p><strong>How does the API relate to how meta boxes could be handled in Gutenberg? If the API were in core, how would it influence the discussion?</strong></p>\n<p>Hereâ€™s where the irony sets in. If we were successful in getting a Fields API into WordPress before Gutenberg was a thing, the ability for Gutenberg to revamp as much as it has planned to revamp in the post editor, would not be as hindered as it is now.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem I see facing Gutenberg is reining in the scope that covers meta boxes. They need to get things working for meta boxes that are already being registered and used by plugin developers.</p>\n<p>If Fields API were a part of WordPress, they would still need to keep backwards compatibility but I could easily add a meta box with my fields into the proposed Gutenberg meta boxes (still in discussion) with just a few lines of code. Plus, my fields and meta boxes registered using the Fields API would work just fine on pre-Gutenberg sites.</p>\n<p>Another parallel here would be the User edit screen, which has had <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/03/fields-api-request-for-review-of-direction/\">much discussion</a> about revamping the way it looks. Itâ€™s very difficult to revamp it and give it consistency without a Fields API already in place. It&#8217;s not impossible, but many problems come to the surface during any approach to &#8216;React-ify&#8217; it, utilize meta boxes, or whatever it would use.</p>\n<p><strong>How can people get involved/contribute to the Fields API project?</strong></p>\n<p>Iâ€™m very excited to have others interested in moving the project along.

This is very worrying for the future of WordPress as a CMS.&#8221;</p>\n<p>James Nylen, one of the lead developers on the project, reassured followers of the topic that the Gutenberg team has not forgotten about the issue but rather that it is &#8220;an extremely complicated issue that we are only beginning to look into, along with many, many other priorities for getting the editor working well.&#8221; He also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952#issuecomment-320523428\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a> for help from the community in planning and testing implementations for supporting meta boxes.</p>\n<p>This response left many things unclear. Participants in the discussion, many of whom are developers concerned about about the prospect of having to rewrite all of their meta boxes as React components, are wondering why meta boxes cannot work alongside the new Gutenberg editor and why the team chose to include meta boxes in the scope of the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Is it possible to replace the existing TinyMCE post editor with Gutenberg while leaving the rest of the interface, including meta boxes and existing hooks, unchanged?&#8221; Kevin Hoffman asked. When Nylen clarified that Gutenberg, as written today, is intended to be a <code>post_content</code> editor, Hoffman summarized the concerns that many developers have expressed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If Gutenberg is truly intended to be a <code>post_content</code> editor, then meta boxes should be left alone as they are not concerned with <code>post_content</code>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore the need for an API to translate PHP meta boxes into React meta boxes is a manufactured problem. It does not have to be a problem, but it has become a problem because somewhere along the line it was decided that rewriting the <code>post_content</code> editor should also completely change how meta boxes work.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve outlined the tremendous challenge of writing such an API in <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2251\" target=\"_blank\">#2251</a>. Translating PHP meta boxes into React for a popular custom fields solution like ACF is challenging enough, let alone trying to do so for every meta box implementation that exists today, popular or not. It does not scale.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As the Gutenberg contributors shared that they have only just begun to look into the meta box issue, it&#8217;s now clear why there is no roadmap for how the project will handle &#8220;legacy&#8221; PHP meta boxes. In July, Nylen said, &#8220;If I had to guess where we will end up here: current metaboxes will be moved to a &#8220;legacy&#8221; area and we will provide APIs, documentation, and examples for registering &#8216;new-style&#8217; metabox-block-thingies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Plugin developers who manage meta box libraries, agencies, and other concerned parties are following the ticket to find out how to plan for the WordPress 5.0, which has been targeted as the Gutenberg release. Andrey Savchenko <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952#issuecomment-320574699\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a> if WordPress plans to formally deprecate the meta box API, which finally drew a clear answer from the team. Matias Ventura <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952#issuecomment-320644682\" target=\"_blank\">responded</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Does WordPress intend to formally deprecate Metabox API?&#8221;</strong><br />\nNo.</p>\n<p>The question that is not fully answered yet is how do meta-boxes work in the context of the Gutenberg editor. Should they remain the same or evolve? How can we move towards the design goals with the least amount of disruption possible?</p>\n<p>This issue has been lingering not due to a lack of desire, but lack of resources. The primary focus for this project is to offer a rich content editing interface that optimizes for direct manipulation of user content through the notion of blocks. (Having used meta-boxes extensively for various projects, I believe blocks can offer a better step forwards for many of those needs while providing a better user experience.)&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ventura listed several options the team has considered for handling meta boxes and requested help from the community to build the best solution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we detect a meta-box is registered we can fallback to the old interface, nothing changes.</li>\n<li>We could split editing the content and modifying meta information into two screens or stages.</li>\n<li>We can try to see how feasible it is to render these as they are (PHP) below the content: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2251\" target=\"_blank\">#2251</a>.</li>\n<li>A theme/plugin/CPT could unregister the new interface as needed.</li>\n<li>Various items that relied on meta boxes could be converted to blocks for UI (still storing data separately).</li>\n<li>We could implement API based meta boxes extensibility like the Fields API.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When pressed to answer the question of why meta boxes are being included in the context of the new editor, Gutenberg design lead Joen Asmussen clarified how the team decided to include meta boxes in the scope of the project:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Gutenberg did start just with the editor box. The kickoff goal was to unify multiple disparate interfaces under a single unified block interface. It quickly become apparent that in order for us to create a compelling experience revolving around this unified block interface, we had to consider the full writing flow, including settings and publishing.</p>\n<p>If the key strength of WordPress is to make it easy for anyone to create rich posts, then we can&#8217;t just design for those of us who already know how to use the editor. We have to consider users who&#8217;ve never used WordPress before, and what they expect in a modern publishing interface. Otherwise we&#8217;d just be adding cognitive load to an already heavy interface.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The question of how meta boxes will fit into the context of the Gutenberg editor is still open. Participants in the discussion are eager to have this question answered for the sake of backwards compatibility and also because it affects ongoing decisions regarding Gutenberg development and screen design.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I completely get how much work has been done towards the &#8216;screen&#8217; replacement approach,&#8221; Xavi Ivars <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952#issuecomment-320771891\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the issue. &#8220;But shouldn&#8217;t a project that started with the goal of a &#8216;post content editor&#8217; replacement, have gone back to the community before deciding unilaterally that it would replace the whole editor screen?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The meta box API isn&#8217;t being deprecated but there&#8217;s also no clear path forward for how Gutenberg will support &#8220;legacy&#8221; PHP meta boxes. The Gutenberg team said the issue has not been solved due to lack of resources. The project needs community input and better communication if the team is going to land on a solution that will seamlessly usher the majority of WordPress sites into the Gutenberg era with the least amount of breakage.</p>\n<p>Currently, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2251\" target=\"_blank\">the feasibility of rendering legacy PHP meta boxes below the content</a> is fraught with challenges and still up for debate. If there isn&#8217;t enough time or client resources for developers to rewrite their work into JS-driven meta boxes, then a clear path for opting out of the Gutenberg interface may be necessary for sites that need to preserve the legacy &#8220;PHP&#8221; meta boxes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 08 Aug 2017 19:54:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.7.0 Adds Opt-In Usage Tracking\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73912\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-7-0-adds-opt-in-usage-tracking\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6304:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/04/whats-new-in-gutenberg-4th-august/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 0.7.0</a> was released just before the weekend with improvements to the writing flow and greater flexibility for theme authors to add their own customizations. Last week&#8217;s version 0.6.0 release made significant changes to the way paragraphs are created within text blocks, allowing for blocks to split when pressing enter. However, it inserted a &#8220;New Paragraph&#8221; placeholder that was distracting for users trying to stay in the flow of writing.</p>\n<p>Version 0.7.0 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2161\" target=\"_blank\">hides placeholders on focus</a>, providing a cleaner experience of starting a new paragraph. After a user has already intuitively initiated a new paragraph by pressing enter, the &#8220;New Paragraph&#8221; placeholder holds little value. Removing the placeholder is a minor improvement that brings Gutenberg closer to providing a better experience for long-form writing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/new-paragraph-gutenberg-0-7-0.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also introduces <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2186\" target=\"_blank\">theme support for customized color palettes and a shared component</a>, such as cover text and button blocks. The sample code below shows how easy it would be for theme authors to implement their own color palettes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/theme-support-color-palette.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg contributors have also added <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2021\" target=\"_blank\">theme support for wide images</a>. According to the inline docs, this allows for some blocks, such as the image block, to define a &#8220;wide&#8221; or &#8220;full&#8221; alignment by adding the corresponding classname to the block&#8217;s wrapper ( <code>alignwide</code> or <code>alignfull</code> ).</p>\n<p>These additions offer theme developers a better picture of where Gutenberg is headed in regards to themes. The plugin&#8217;s contributors are slowly building in more points of customization so that theme authors can add or override Gutenberg&#8217;s styles and provide additional opt-in features to their users.</p>\n<p>Theme support for wide images has already been committed to Tammie Lister&#8217;s experimental <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg-theme\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg Theme</a>. The project was created to showcase how Gutenberg will interact with WordPress themes and is still a work in progress.</p>\n<h3>Gutenberg Adds Opt-In Data Collection</h3>\n<p>After updating the Gutenberg plugin to 0.7.0 and navigating to the editor, users are presented with the option to opt into data collection about their usage of the editor. The usage data, which is anonymous and does not include post content, is sent to WordPress.com for future analysis. Gutenberg contributor James Nylen explained how the data tracking works in a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/06/opt-in-usage-tracking-in-gutenberg/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on Make.WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Gutenberg plugin contains a mechanism to count how often specific actions occur over time,&#8221; Nylen said. &#8220;If the user has previously clicked &#8216;Yes&#8217; on this screen, and an event occurs that has an associated <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=bumpStat&type=\" target=\"_blank\">bumpStat call</a> in the Gutenberg code, then this event is sent to WordPress.com servers by loading a special &#8216;pixel&#8217; image.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg&#8217;s tracking code stores the â€œgroupâ€� and â€œnameâ€� sent with the bumpStat call (short strings of text), along with the time the event was recorded. Nylen said the team will use the data to improve the editor based on usage patterns. This data collection information is currently only available to those with access to WordPress.com servers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As Gutenberg is an open-source community project, we view this data as belonging to the WordPress community, so we also plan to make this data available via a public dashboard,&#8221; Nylen said.</p>\n<p>He shared an example of the data that has been collected from the plugin over the past few days since 0.7.0 was released. This chart is a preview of the number and types of blocks that users have added to posts while testing the editor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gutenberg-add-block-total-e1502130689795.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The approach taken here is very similar to Calypso&#8217;s event tracking code,&#8221; Nylen said in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2140\" target=\"_blank\">pull request for adding the data collection</a>. &#8220;We can use the data added in this PR to inform various decisions such as default order for blocks and whether some blocks are less suitable for core, and more generally this is a very useful technique to collect user experience data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The majority of Gutenberg&#8217;s chief contributors are Automattic employees, so it makes sense that they would use the options and infrastructure available to them to quickly get data collection going in Gutenberg. However, the data from these tests needs to be shared with the greater WordPress community as soon as possible, since it is being collected in the name of the WordPress project. Ideally, it would have been set up to be displayed publicly before asking users to opt into the collection.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg contributors are also considering making the data collection more modular so that it could be used with other WordPress feature plugins or existing features in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maybe the tracking could be its own module, it could be useful outside of the editor (and other WP feature plugins later),&#8221; Riad Benguella <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2140#discussion_r130839438\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;Longer term (or not), WP.org needs its own tracking infrastructure and this could be very useful to enhance WordPress.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 07 Aug 2017 20:05:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"WPTavern: Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Dismisses Automatticâ€™s Trademark Dispute Against Chris Pearson\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73899\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:115:\"https://wptavern.com/trademark-trial-and-appeal-board-dismisses-automattics-trademark-dispute-against-chris-pearson\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4131:\"<p>In July 2015, Automattic <a href=\"http://www.adrforum.com/domaindecisions/1613723.htm\">won its <span class=\"_Tgc\"> Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy</span> (UDRP) case</a> against <a href=\"http://www.pearsonified.com/\">Chris Pearson</a> regarding Thesis.com after the <a href=\"http://www.adrforum.com/domaindecisions/1613723.htm\">panel determined</a> that he failed to establish all three elements required under the ICANN Policy.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A party must satisfy all three of the burdens imposed under the Policy in order for the Panel to order transfer of a domain name from the entity registering it.

Automattic retaliated by <a href=\"http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92061714&pty=CAN&eno=1\">filing a petition</a> for cancellation with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In the petition, Automattic argued that the three trademarks owned by Pearson, DIYTHEMES, THESIS THEME, and THESIS, should be cancelled.</p>\n<p>For the past two years, legal teams for both parties have gone back and forth filing briefs, requests for extensions, and other documents. Earlier this year on April 20th, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board <a href=\"http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92061714&pty=CAN&eno=19\">dismissed the case</a> citing a lack of evidence and testimony from Automattic that establishes real interest and a reasonable belief in damages.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The record is devoid of any evidence concerning the nature of Petitionerâ€™s (Automattic) commercial activities and its interest in Respondentâ€™s (Chris Pearson) registered marks.

Thus, on the record before us, Petitioner has failed to establish a &#8216;real interest&#8217; and &#8216;reasonable belief in damage.&#8217; Accordingly, the cancellation proceeding is dismissed for Petitionerâ€™s lack of standing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On May 22nd,<a href=\"http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92061714&pty=CAN&eno=20\"> Automattic filed a motion</a> for the board to reconsider its decision.

Yes, segments of it are and will continue to do so. Itâ€™s like in any industry: the car replaced the horse and the robot replaced the factory worker.

In early 2016, Medium convinced a collection of small, independent publications to move to its platform but shortly thereafter discontinued its unsuccessful ad-driven publishing model <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/when-you-launch-your-publication-the-same-day-medium-changes\" target=\"_blank\">without notifying publishers</a>.</p>\n<p>In March 2017, Medium CEO Ev Williams announced that his solution to fix the broken, ad-driven media industry was to fire up <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/medium-aims-to-fix-broken-media-with-new-5-subscription-program\" target=\"_blank\">a new $5 subscription program</a> that would put articles behind a paywall inside of the Medium network.</p>\n<p>Today The Awl, The Hairpin, and The Billfold announced the publications have <a href=\"https://www.theawl.com/2017/08/somethings-different/\" target=\"_blank\">moved back to WordPress</a> after switching to Medium in April 2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The move to Medium was a cool experiment, in my opinion, but the year is up and personally I missed the ads,&#8221; The Awl Editor Silvia Killingsworth said. <a href=\"https://www.thebillfold.com/2017/08/change-is-the-only-constant-in-life/\" target=\"_blank\">The Billfold&#8217;s announcement</a> cited Mediums&#8217; recent changes as the reason for the move back to WordPress:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our move to Medium was an experiment to explore a different kind of business model, and that experiment is over now that the platform has moved in a different direction (<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/publishers-flee-medium-amid-business-model-changes-2440471520.html\" target=\"_blank\">you can read more in-depth about those changes here</a>).</p>\n<p>Adapting to change is all part of the many joys of being a small, independent publisher.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Film School Rejects Returns to WordPress After 1-Year Experiment with Medium</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/what-happened-with-medium/\" target=\"_blank\">Film School Rejects (FSR) also returned to WordPress in May</a> after a year-long, rocky experiment with Medium. The publication was one of Medium&#8217;s first 12 premium publishers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, I can&#8217;t afford, nor would my heart hold up for, a move back to a private server and WordPress,&#8221; FSR founder Neil Miller <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/2017/why-publishers-are-sticking-with-medium-for-now/444507/\" target=\"_blank\">told Poynter in January</a> after Medium announced it was pivoting away from ad-driven media. &#8220;So, barring a miracle, my site will live and die on Medium. I&#8217;m optimistic that I&#8217;ll find some sort of solution and be able to remain on Medium.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Medium&#8217;s goals as a publisher of subscription content were at odds with FSR&#8217;s ability to sustain the publication. Miller said they had ported 10 years of content over to the platform after being promised a beautiful user experience and a way forward that would allow FSR to grown the business, continue to pay its writers, and keep the publication on the cutting edge.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What we were sold when we joined their platform is very different from what they&#8217;re offering as a way forward,&#8221; Miller told Poynter. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost as if Ev Williams wasn&#8217;t concerned that he was pulling out the rug from underneath publishers who had placed their trust in his vision for the future of journalism.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After moving FSR back to WordPress, Miller said the partnership with Medium was great until the company changed course to become a different type of platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As time went on, it became clear that Mediumâ€™s priorities had shifted from being a platform for independent publishers to being itself a publisher of premium, subscription-based content,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As we learned more about their future plans for the now-existent Medium â€˜Members Onlyâ€™ program, it became clear that our site wouldnâ€™t be able to continue to operate the way we always had.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Miller said the process of trying a new platform and returning to WordPress made him realize that he &#8220;missed some of the customizable features of WordPress,&#8221; which led his team to work on some new features they will be launching in the future. The site has reinstated its banner advertising on pages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Weâ€™d love to be able to do this all without any ads, but thereâ€™s no money in that,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;And guess who doesnâ€™t get paid if the site canâ€™t make any money? The people who write articles, edit the site, make video essays, curate One Perfect Shot, and host podcasts.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>ThinkProgress Exits Medium, Founder Says Platform is No Longer Developed with Publishers in Mind</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ThinkProgress</a> was one of the largest publications to make the move to Medium last August. After less than a year, the site has moved back to WordPress, its previous publishing platform. ThinkProgress founder Judd Legum told <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/2017/with-big-plans-to-staff-up-thinkprogress-is-leaving-medium-behind-update/465424/\" target=\"_blank\">Poynter</a> that the lack of advertising capabilities was not the reason his publication left the platform but rather because Medium no longer serves the best interests of publishers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m certainly not eager to have a bunch of ads on the site â€” and we&#8217;re not going to,&#8221; Legum said. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to have none. And if it were possible, I&#8217;d be interested in figuring out a model where we don&#8217;t have to have any. But if it&#8217;s connected to a platform that&#8217;s not going to be developed with publishers in mind, it doesn&#8217;t really make sense to think through that as a platform. That sealed it for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>ThinkProgress is taking its 8 to 10 million unique pageviews per month back into the independent publishing space. It is the latest of several other publishers leaving Medium after having been persuaded in 2016 to jump into Ev Williams&#8217; experiment with initial promises of free hosting, more traffic, and advertising money. Not all of the sites are moving back to WordPress, but most are looking to free themselves from Medium&#8217;s experiment on publishers and regain the ability to sell advertising and/or subscriptions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/bill-simmons-moves-the-ringer-from-medium-to-vox-media-2426770782.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Ringer moved to Vox Media</a> at the end of May after Medium discontinued its advertising model. <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/2017/after-being-wooed-by-medium-some-publishers-are-beginning-to-leave/459998/\" target=\"_blank\">The Pacific Standard left Medium</a> to focus on building custom features to drive subscription growth.</p>\n<p>Backchannel also moved its site off of the platform and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/backchannel-is-moving-to-wired\" target=\"_blank\">is now publishing on Wired.com</a>. &#8220;In the time since Backchannel launched, Medium has shifted its business strategy, and itâ€™s no longer as focused on helping publications like ours profit,&#8221; BackChannel Editor Jessi Hempel said.</p>\n<p>Medium&#8217;s new <a href=\"https://medium.com/membership\" target=\"_blank\">subscription revenue model</a> and partner program are still in beta but the returns have not been enough to convince publishers to stay, even with costly migrations back to tried and proven platforms like WordPress. Ad-driven publishing may not be the most ideal way to keep a publication afloat, but publishers moving away from Medium are not willing to stay on for the the startup&#8217;s experiment at the expense of their writers and staff.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 04 Aug 2017 23:09:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8.1 Released, Adds Custom HTML Widget\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73825\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-1-released-adds-custom-html-widget\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:901:\"<p>WordPress 4.8.1 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/wordpress-4-8-1-maintenance-release/\">is available for download</a> or as an update from the WordPress Dashboard.

The success of previous events has generated momentum to continue the 24-hour global translation sprints and has also increased the visibility of the Polyglots team&#8217;s contributions. These sprints have provided a catalyst for the team&#8217;s growth from 5,000 contributors in April 2015 to 17,000 in November 2016. The greater WordPress community has also grown in tandem, as reliable translations are the lifeblood of international WordPress usage.</p>\n<p>One way of measuring the growth of the global community is the checking the status of local meetups. After the addition of the dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8, the community has seen a sharp rise in <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">meetup group</a> growth, according to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">recent stats</a> from the community team. The widget displays local WordPress events for logged-in users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Itâ€™s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably â€” since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program,&#8221; Hugh Lashbrooke said. &#8220;This is compared to 19 new groups and only 7,071 new members in the same time period last year.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wordpress-meetups.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Much of that growth can be attributed to the growth of the international WordPress community, which has continued to advance the concept of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/07/18/regional-camps-take-2/\" target=\"_blank\">regional WordCamps</a> for countries and continents. These include events such as WordCamp Netherlands, WordCamp Europe, and the planned WordCamp Asia, that bring larger groups of WordPress enthusiasts together around a common region.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the WordPress community hosted 80 WordCamps in 29 countries. At the conclusion of 2016, there were 115 total WordCamps hosted in 41 different countries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress&#8217; usage</a> continues to grow every year, and the percentage of non-English-speaking users is also expanding. In 2014, non-English WordPress downloads surpassed English downloads for the first time.</p>\n<p>Last July, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-stats-page-redesigned-adds-new-data-on-installs-by-langauge\" target=\"_blank\">53.9% of WordPress sites used the English (US) locale</a>. That number has dropped to 50% as of today, as international usage continues to rise.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wordpress-locales-july-2017.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Stats from WordPress.org July 2017\n<p>Rahul Bansal&#8217;s lightning talk at WordCamp Europe identified one example of <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2017/06/21/rahul-bansal-how-translation-sprints-helps-bring-in-new-contributors/\" target=\"_blank\">how the translation sprints are bringing in new contributors in India</a>. In the past, meetup groups have had a problem with retaining new users, who often come to their first meetup lacking both a sense of belonging and confidence in contributing. Bansal and other Polyglots members had an idea to remove this block to contributing by getting new users involved in translating WordPress.</p>\n<p>During the last global translation day event, Bansal helped organize a local group to translate WordPress core into Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati. They also translated the subtitles for the WordPress 4.6 release video. The key was that the leaders did not participate in translating strings but rather focused on guiding new translators &#8211; 90% ended up being first-time contributors.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.6 shipped with support for 50 languages and the complete Gujarati translation was added to core just a few days before the release. Its inclusion in the release made WordPress more accessible to approximately 65.5 million Gujarati speakers worldwide.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrap\"></div>\n<p>The 3rd Global WordPress Translation Day falls on the same day that the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/ga11914.doc.htm\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations has designated as International Translation Day</a>, a new initiative to recognize &#8220;the role of professional translation in connection with nations and fostering peace, understanding, and development.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress has only just begun to explore its potential to democratize publishing and hasn&#8217;t even cracked the ice in terms of usage across the world&#8217;s most popular languages. Sites using the various Chinese and Arabic locales make up less than 2% of international usage, despite these languages having more than a billion native speakers combined. If WordPress adoption takes off in these parts of the world, it will create a whole new wave of contribution and vastly expand the world market for commercial plugins and themes. The Polyglots team are on the forefront of making this possible.</p>\n<p>The first two WPTranslationDay events were held in April and November of 2016. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/2nd-global-wordpress-translation-day-brings-780-translators-together-across-133-locales\" target=\"_blank\">second event had a 74% increase in participation over the first</a> with a total of 780 translators participating.

Iâ€™m a female developer but Iâ€™ve never really felt like that is anything too special and more importantly I have rarely felt like my gender mattered.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As a kid I thought I would become an artist or a dancer. It wasnâ€™t until I had to choose the university to apply to that I decided to go with something more practical so I went with Computer Science. I hadnâ€™t really done much with code before that, except for having a Lord of the Rings discussion board with my friends and making doing some HTML &amp; CSS related to that. After the first year of school I was already making my first WordPress sites to paying customers.</p>\n<p>After graduating I have been a full-time employee in a developer position as well as a freelancer. Iâ€™ve worked both in Finland and in the USA. During my career I have actually been surprised how easy it has been for me, a woman in the male-dominated industry, to find work, to get promoted and to get recognition. I have not faced much discrimination or prejudice related to my gender, and the great professionals I have got to work with have always been interested in my skills beyond anything else.</p>\n<p>So how come there is such a huge gender gap in the industry? Iâ€™ve witnessed it myself many times &#8211; being the only woman in a WordPress meetup of thirty people, or not having to queue at all to womenâ€™s bathroom in a tech conference with over 1000 attendees. There is no doubt that women are as capable as men, so whatever the reason is I really hope the future women would see the fun, problem-solving profession of a programmer as a great career option.</p>\n<h3>A few tips for an aspiring developer</h3>\n<p>I want to encourage everyone considering a developer career to take action and go for it. The tech industry is full of very clever and inspiring people and I promise you will not be bored. More importantly it is a safe career choice: the job market is great and the companies and the different tech communities are generally very open and welcoming. If you want to be a woman person in tech, remember:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do not accept <del>gender</del> any discrimination</strong><br />\nOne great thing about being a developer is the current status of the job market. There is a lot more demand than there is supply, so you can choose who you work with. Do not put up with discrimination, talk about it openly and stand against it. Iâ€™ve been lucky enough not to face much judgement based on my gender. Iâ€™ve worked both in Finland and in the US and the biggest challenges Iâ€™ve faced have been clients that have been surprised that a woman is the tech lead in their project. Usually after a few hours of working together the prejudice disappears &#8211; it has always been enough to just be professional and stay true to myself.</li>\n<li><strong>Be active and give back</strong><br />\nIt is important to be active in your community and help other people out in their careers. Everyone benefits from a striving local community and also it is a great opportunity to make new connections and open new doors in your career.Being an organiser of WordCamp Finland &amp; WordPress Helsinki meetup group for the last few years has really given me more than it has taken. Iâ€™ve learnt a lot and met many inspiring people, and it has opened up new career options for me too. The best thing tho has been just seeing the Finnish community grow so much and get more active by the day.</li>\n<li><strong>It&#8217;s skills that matter</strong><br />\nThis is really what it comes down to. Are you developing your skills constantly? Are you willing to keep up with the industry? You do not have to be the best developer, but you should be confident in your skills and be willing to always learn new ones. I believe that this is the only thing that matters in the end &#8211; not your gender.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Your%20Skills%20Speak%20Louder%20Than%20Your%20Gender&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fskills-speak-louder-gender%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fskills-speak-louder-gender%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fskills-speak-louder-gender%2F&title=Your+Skills+Speak+Louder+Than+Your+Gender\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/skills-speak-louder-gender/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/080217-min-150x150.jpg&description=Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/skills-speak-louder-gender/\" title=\"Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/skills-speak-louder-gender/\">Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 11:00:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Sonja Jaakkola\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: July 2017\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4885\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5687:\"<p>After a particularly busy month <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2017/\">in June</a>, things settled down a bit in the WordPress world â€” WordPress 4.8â€™s release went very smoothly, allowing the Core team to build up some of the community infrastructure around development. Read on for more interesting news from around the WordPress world in July.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Weekly meeting for new core contributors</h2>\n<p>Onboarding new contributors is a persistent issue for most WordPress contribution teams. While every team welcomes any new contributors, the path to getting deeply involved can be tricky to find at times.</p>\n<p>This month, the Core team implemented a fantastic new initiative: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/announcing-a-weekly-new-contributors-meeting/\">weekly meetings for new core contributors</a> as a way to encourage involvement and foster fresh contributions. The meetings not only focus on bugs suited to first-time contributors, they also make space for experienced contributors to help out individuals who may be new to developing WordPress core.</p>\n<p>The meetings are held every Wednesday at 19:00 UTC in the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Increased focus on PHP practices in WordPress core</h2>\n<p>In bringing people together to improve WordPress core, a new channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> named #core-php is designed to focus on PHP development in the project.</p>\n<p>Along with this increased concentration on PHP, a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/06/announcement-for-weekly-php-meetings/\">new weekly meeting is now taking place</a> every Monday at 18:00 UTC in #core-php to improve WordPress coreâ€™s PHP practices.</p>\n<h2>Sharp rise in meetup group growth</h2>\n<p>The dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8 displays local, upcoming WordPress events for the logged in user. The events listed in this widget are pulled from the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">meetup chapter program</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule\">WordCamp schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>This widget provides greater visibility of official WordPress events, and encourages community involvement in these events. Itâ€™s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably â€” since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program. This is compared to 19 new groups and only 7,071 new members in the same time period last year.</p>\n<p>You can find a local meetup group to join <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">on meetup.com</a>, and if you would like to get involved in organizing events for your community, you can find out more about the inner workings of the program <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/\">on the Community Team site</a> or by joining the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8.1 due for imminent release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 cycleâ€™s first maintenance release will be published in the coming week, more than a month after 4.8 was released. This release fix some important issues in WordPress core and the majority of users will find that their sites will update to this new version automatically.</p>\n<p>If you would like to help out by testing this release before it goes live, you can follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/beta/\">beta testing guide</a> for WordPress core. To get further involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The WordPress mobile apps have been updated with <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/07/24/a-brand-new-editor-for-the-wordpress-mobile-apps/\">a brand new text editor</a>.</li>\n<li>In a recent push to encourage WordPress users to upgrade their PHP versions, two features have been proposed &#8211; one <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41191\">to provide a notice to users</a> and another to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934\">allow PHP version requirements to be specified by plugins and themes</a>.</li>\n<li>John Maeda wrote <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2017/07/14/whywordpress2/\">a great post</a> celebrating the freedom that WordPress offers.</li>\n<li>Gutenberg, the new text editor for WordPress, is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/28/whats-new-in-gutenberg-28th-july/\">in continual development</a> â€” everyone is invited to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">test it out</a>.</li>\n<li>The WordPress Meta team is starting <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2017/07/26/experiment-wordcamp-org-bug-scrubs/\">a new initiative</a> to bring the community together to focus on fixing bugs across the WordCamp.org network.</li>\n<li>Volunteer applications for WordCamp US <a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/2017/08/01/wcus-needs-you-volunteer-applications-are-now-open/\">are now open</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next â€œMonth in WordPressâ€� post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 07:50:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Hugh Lashbrooke\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 5.2 Brings Major Improvements to the Contact Form Module\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73816\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-5-2-brings-major-improvements-to-the-contact-form-module\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2280:\"<p>Jetpack&#8217;s <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/contact-form/\" target=\"_blank\">Contact Form module</a> hasn&#8217;t seen too many changes since its first release (<a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2012/04/24/jetpack-1-3-released-contact-forms/\" target=\"_blank\">version 1.3</a>) in 2012.

WordPress&#8217; notification system is often abused and overused by plugin authors who want to inject upsells and announcements into the admin. These can stack up like a pile of junk mail vying for users&#8217; attention when they are trying to manage their sites. Ultimately, notice overload decreases users&#8217; enjoyment of the software and may contribute to making it a chore to log into WordPress.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dobby/\" target=\"_blank\">Dobby plugin</a> from <a href=\"https://tfrommen.de\" target=\"_blank\">Thorsten Frommen</a> attempts to solve this problem by capturing and hiding unwanted admin notices. Frommen, a WordPress engineer at Inpsyde, was inspired to create the plugin after he saw a recent tweet from Torsten Landsiedel showing &#8220;Everyday life in the WordPress dashboard.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"de\" dir=\"ltr\">Alltag im WordPress Dashboard. <a href=\"https://t.co/lofO7544uL\">pic.twitter.com/lofO7544uL</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Torsten Landsiedel (@zodiac1978) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zodiac1978/status/886646392730648577\">July 16, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dobby rolls up WordPress admin notices and keeps them hidden behind a &#8220;Reveal&#8221; button that toggles a color-coded list of notices into view. It captures all the notices that are printed via the admin notice hooks, such as <code>network_admin_notices</code>, <code>user_admin_notices</code>, <code>admin_notices</code> and <code>all_admin_notices</code>. Dobby will post an admin notice if any notices have been captured.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dobby.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Frommen said the target audience for his plugin is &#8220;all the people sick and tired of too many admin notifications, which are oftentimes of no real value at all.&#8221; Dobby has a filter available for users to define what &#8220;too many&#8221; means for themselves. The <a href=\"https://github.com/tfrommen/Dobby\" target=\"_blank\">plugin&#8217;s GitHub repository</a> has examples of how to use the Dobby filter threshold, which lets users customize the minimum number of admin notices required to trigger Dobby to start hiding them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It certainly is possible that people may miss (critical) messages with Dobby being active,&#8221; Frommen said. &#8220;However, Dobby is smart enough to style his admin notice according to the most critical one captured. This means that Dobby&#8217;s notice will have error styling if there was an error notice captured. If the most critical one was a warning, thatâ€™s what Dobbyâ€™s notice will be as well. Otherwise, itâ€™s an info notice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Within the first 10 minutes of requesting translations after announcing that Dobby was on WordPress.org, Frommen received German and Dutch translations for the plugin. The plugin UI has only two strings, which makes it a simple, 5-minute translation job.</p>\n<p>Frommen is considering adding a filter for people to define what kind of notices they would like Dobby to capture. He welcomes suggestions, <a href=\"https://github.com/tfrommen/Dobby\" target=\"_blank\">contributions on GitHub</a>, and <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-dobby\" target=\"_blank\">more translations</a> from the WordPress community.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 01 Aug 2017 18:30:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.6.0 Changes Text/Paragraph Block Behavior, Adds New Cover Text and Read More Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73735\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-6-0-changes-textparagraph-block-behavior-adds-new-cover-text-and-read-more-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8239:\"<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/paragraph.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: A Tiny Break From The Rain <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/78814955@N00/34165889514\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f430.png\" alt=\"ðŸ�°\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />Adventures In Wonderland &#038; Through The Looking Glass<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f430.png\" alt=\"ðŸ�°\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/28/whats-new-in-gutenberg-28th-july/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 0.6.0</a> was released over the weekend with significant changes to the way paragraphs are created within text blocks. In previous versions of the plugin, pressing enter would create a line break inside a paragraph. This release modifies the behavior of the text/paragraph block to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1989\" target=\"_blank\">split the block when a user presses enter</a>. (Line breaks can still be created by pressing SHIFT+ENTER.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gutenberg-new-paragraph.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This update is a small improvement in that it hides the text formatting bar when you continue on with a new paragraph, but the slightest scroll or move of the mouse brings it back into view. Contributors are <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1812#issuecomment-314045186\" target=\"_blank\">considering adding a buffer</a> at some point that would only trigger the UI after the mouse moves a certain number of pixels.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the &#8220;New Paragraph&#8221; placeholder text is intrusive and distracting. It is a constant, unwanted reminder of the structure of your document, which is not helpful if you are trying to stay in the flow of writing.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg may improve the experience of vertically stacking differently formatted content, but the writing experience still needs a great deal of work before it can be comparable to what WordPress currently provides. The new editor still gets in the way of writing, instead of silently enabling it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I love Gutenberg so far, but this is too many dongles to display at the moment of focusing on writing. <a href=\"https://t.co/Xpb19KgG01\">pic.twitter.com/Xpb19KgG01</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Daniel Bachhuber (@danielbachhuber) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielbachhuber/status/889944454643064832\">July 25, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>After browsing the Gutenberg repository&#8217;s 400+ issues queue, it&#8217;s clear that contributors are aware of the jarring experience for writers and are working to improve it in every release. However, the beta software is not anywhere near ready for long-form writing, as the intrusive UI places too many cognitive demands on the writer.</p>\n<h3>New Blocks in 0.6.0: &#8220;Cover Text&#8221; and &#8220;Read More&#8221;</h3>\n<p>This release introduces a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2036\" target=\"_blank\">new &#8220;Cover Text&#8221; block</a> that includes background, text color, and full-width options. Color swatches are available in the sidebar block options and contributors are planning to add filters to allow plugin and theme authors to supply a custom palette.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cover-text.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 0.6.0 also includes a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1440\" target=\"_blank\">new &#8220;Read More&#8221; block</a> that inserts a read more link with instant visual feedback within the content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/read-more-block.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also brings several improvements to existing blocks, autosaving for drafts, and initial support for undo/redo keyboard functions.</p>\n<h3>Gutenberg&#8217;s Negative Reviews are Piling Up on WordPress.org</h3>\n<p>Gutenberg contributors are regularly shipping weekly releases, with many features added as bare bones placeholders that will be iterated on in future releases. New blocks are being developed simultaneously with core editing features. Some testers have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-5-0-adds-new-verse-block-for-poetry-and-a-new-display-for-recent-blocks#comment-224944\" target=\"_blank\">bemoaned the proliferation of blocks</a> that may seldom be used while the basic writing experience continues to lag behind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/gutenberg/reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg plugin reviews</a> are currently averaging 2.3 out of 5 stars on WordPress.org, with 46 1-star reviews, 21 5-star reviews, and a handful in between. While the reviews are not a full representation of all who are testing Gutenberg, they provide a small window into users&#8217; current expectations, delights, and frustrations with the editor. Gutenberg contributors are monitoring these forums and using the feedback to create bug reports.</p>\n<p>Many reviewers have left 1-star ratings, begging WordPress to keep it as a plugin instead of adding it to core. One reviewer even took to verse to further elaborate on his one-star review titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/catastophe-how-to-destroy-wordpress-in-2-weeks/\" target=\"_blank\">A Visit from St. Gutenberg</a>&#8221; with an adaptation of the classic poem &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Visit_from_St._Nicholas\" target=\"_blank\">The Night Before Christmas</a>:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nA bundle of blocks he had flung on his back,<br />\nAnd he looked like a coder just opening his pack.</p>\n<p>His eyesâ€”how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!<br />\nâ€œWho needs MCE, when we have blocks and so many?â€�</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many reviewers find Gutenberg to be &#8220;unnecessarily complex&#8221; for actions that were previously easy to perform in the editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have several websites &#8211; two are for business and include blogs (technical posts, how-tos, etc),&#8221; @quantaweb <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/please-make-it-a-plugin-not-part-of-core/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;Iâ€™m also the editor of a literary magazine. This doesnâ€™t work for any of these sites. Itâ€™s not easier to write blogs with it, and it does nothing to ease the work of importing critical essays and poetry into the literary magazine â€” and formatting them â€” either&#8230;Gutenberg is unnecessarily complex.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some of the 1-star reviews come laced with threats to move to another CMS and splinter the WordPress community if Gutenberg is included in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By removing all the traditional editor buttons and trying to make a minimalist design the usefulness and ease of use has been drastically reduced,&#8221; @ovann86 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-example-of-why-developers-are-not-ux-experts/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;I found myself either not being able to do very basic content management or having to click, hover and look for the buttons â€“ instead of them being visible and available immediately&#8230;If this was made core I would likely be forced to move to another CMS.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Early testing of beta software is not for everyone, as many are unable to look past the initial bugs and clunky implementations to see the potential of the editor to improve WordPress&#8217; severely fragmented content creation experience. Matt Mullenweg jumped onto the forums as recently as two weeks ago to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/not-ready-for-prime-time-14/#post-9316327\" target=\"_blank\">respond to testers&#8217; feedback</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We definitely agree itâ€™s not ready for prime time yet, thatâ€™s why weâ€™re doing extensive public testing and iteration while itâ€™s in the plugin phase,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Thank you for your feedback and I hope you try it again in a few months with an open mind.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 31 Jul 2017

at WordCamp Europe I had the opportunity to meet Russian designer and developer <a href=\"https://dmtrmrv.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dmitry Mayorov</a>, whose themes I had noticed earlier in the year in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/iamdmitrymayorov/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Theme Directory</a>. Mayorov&#8217;s design style is reminiscent of other niche theme developers like Anders NorÃ©n and Mike McAlister. He launched his own commercial themes business on <a href=\"https://themepatio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ThemePatio.com</a> two years ago and his free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/counter/\" target=\"_blank\">Counter</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/maker/\" target=\"_blank\">Maker</a> themes collectively have more than 3,000 active installs on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/counter.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/maker.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n<p>Mayorov started taking part in meetups in Russia in 2013. Following WordCamp Moscow 2015, Konstantin Kovshenin asked him if he would take on the role of lead organizer. Mayorov is organizing <a href=\"https://2017.moscow.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Moscow 2017</a>, which is scheduled for August 12. In our interview below, he describes a few of the challenges organizers face in uniting the Russian WordPress community that is spread out over such a large land mass.</p>\n<p>Mayorov also discusses how he began creating WordPress themes and how clients&#8217; needs influenced his <a href=\"https://themepatio.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">theme development philosophy</a>. He aspires to create themes that are fast, content-focused, and minimalistic, without the bloat of hundreds of font options and pre-built site layouts. Mayorov also gave us his predictions for the future of the theme industry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to go two directions at the same time,&#8221; Mayorov said. &#8220;I think that page builders and multi-purpose themes wont go anywhere but I also think that niche themes are here to stay as well. Not everybody is looking for a page builder.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I see the tendency that at first when people get introduced to WordPress they discover theme marketplaces. They think, &#8216;Ok this is the top seller, I&#8217;m going to go with this theme.&#8217; For some people it works, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, because sometimes you have challenges where you need to create a website like yesterday&#8230;Once they see that there is another way, they start to research other theme developers and shops, realizing that there are simple themes that work faster and are easier to use, and that you don&#8217;t need to spend two hours trying to create the homepage. They will use those themes as well. These are the themes I&#8217;m trying to build.&#8221;</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 19:57:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Customize Snapshots 0.6.0 Adds the Ability to Name and Merge Changesets\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73700\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/customize-snapshots-0-6-0-adds-the-ability-to-name-and-merge-changesets\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5042:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/snapshots.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/T80PGTWXHZ\">Freestocks.org</a>\n<p>Contributors to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-snapshots/\" target=\"_blank\">Customize Snapshots</a> feature plugin are steadily building a UI for managing Customizer changesets using the changesets infrastructure added in WordPress 4.7. <a href=\"https://make.xwp.co/2017/07/27/customize-snapshots-0-6-release/\" target=\"_blank\">Version 0.6.0</a> of the plugin was released this month with an expanded interface for managing the complexities of multi-user editing in the Customizer.</p>\n<p>The previous version of Customize Snapshots already supported scheduling but this release introduces a new multi-select save button that allows users to publish, save draft, save as pending, or schedule changes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/customize-snapshots-multi-select-button.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 0.6.0 adds the ability to name changesets, which is especially helpful for site owners who are sorting and previewing changes submitted by multiple editors. The list of changesets has links for previewing on the frontend, editing in the Customizer, or inspecting the changeset&#8217;s content on the edit post screen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/saved-changesets.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release introduces the ability to merge multiple changesets into a single changeset, which users can then preview and publish all at once.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/merge-changesets.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Contributors have not yet worked out how this feature will handle conflicting changes submitted by multiple users. It currently accepts whatever change was made more recently, but this isn&#8217;t ideal in certain situations. <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20conflict\" target=\"_blank\">Conflict resolution</a> is on the team&#8217;s radar to address in future iterations of the plugin and they are discussing several different approaches.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Merging changesets would definitely lie in the realm of a power user feature,&#8221; Customize component co-maintainer Weston Ruter said. &#8220;It would probably not be proposed for core. Nevertheless, the existence of the feature is a demonstration of the kinds of things that can be possible when working with changesets.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to co-leading WordPress&#8217; Customizer team, Ruter is also the CTO at XWP, where several of the agency&#8217;s clients are actively using the Customize Snapshots plugin. News Corp Australia and Beachbody are two companies that have invested in the plugin&#8217;s development and are successfully using it at scale on their network of sites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When paired with the Customize Posts plugin, it gets really powerful because you can edit multiple posts and pages, along with any of their postmeta, while also editing widgets, nav menus, and any other settings, and all of these changes are all bundled together in a single changeset,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;This changeset can then be previewed on the frontend, including by sharing the URL with an unauthenticated user (like a 3rd party who can&#8217;t even access the Customizer), and they can click around the site with all of the customizations applied as if they had been published.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ruter said the Customizer team isn&#8217;t currently targeting a WordPress release for getting these new UI additions added to core but rather view the progress as &#8220;prototypes for what could be merged into core, bit by bit.&#8221; He identified several tickets that the plugin provides prototype interfaces for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28721\" target=\"_blank\">#28721</a>: Scheduled changes for the customizer</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31089\" target=\"_blank\">#31089</a>: Add revisions and statuses for changesets</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21666\" target=\"_blank\">#21666</a>: Customizer reset/undo/revert</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896\" target=\"_blank\">#39896</a>: Customizer: Allow users to Draft changes before Publishing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;Core development is still very much focused on the editor â€” Gutenberg â€” so the far-reaching Customizer changes are not being emphasized yet,&#8221; Ruter said. Meanwhile progress continues on the Customize Snapshots plugin, which was completely rewritten for the 0.6.0 release after most of its infrastructure was merged into WordPress 4.7. Ruter&#8217;s team is not sure which features will eventually land in core, but the various Customizer feature plugins give users an idea of the power of the changesets infrastructure that is already included in WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 22:58:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: .blog Passes 100,000 Registrations, 66.5% of Purchased Domains are in Use\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73673\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/blog-passes-100000-registrations-66-5-of-purchased-domains-are-in-use\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5302:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The .blog domain extension, managed by Automattic subsidiary Knock Knock WHOIS There (KKWT), opened registration to the public in November 2016 and has just <a href=\"https://my.blog/2017/07/26/100000-blogs/\" target=\"_blank\">passed the 100,000 registration milestone</a>. The extension is averaging 300 new .blog domains registered per day and is quickly gaining popularity among new generic TLDs. According to the most recent stats available at nTLDStats, <a href=\"https://ntldstats.com/tld/blog\" target=\"_blank\">.blog registrations</a> have climbed steadily and predictably every month since its public launch.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog-registrations.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>.blog registrations according to ntldstats.com\n<p>Automattic, which operates independently from KKWT as a registrar, currently has the largest market share of .blog domain registrars at 62.8%. Other smaller pieces of the pie continue to see increasing numbers of registrations. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/registrar-market-share-blog.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;When a .blog domain is sold through any .blog registrar, it operates like all other top-level domains (TLDs),&#8221; .blog representative Erica Varlese said. &#8220;This means that the registry, in this case Knock Knock WHOIS There, receives the wholesale cost, ICANN receives their fees, and the registrar retains the rest.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The .blog team has started experimenting with different marketing programs to promote the extension among registrars and launched its first campaigns last month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These programs are available to any .blog accredited registrar and, through participation, allows them to provide .blog domains to their customers at a discounted rate,&#8221; Varlese said. &#8220;It is designed to test price elasticity and various end-user marketing techniques that best fit each registrars&#8217; unique customer-base.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Registration for .blog domains is fully integrated into WordPress.com&#8217;s domain offerings, but Varlese said that Knock Knock WHOIS There, as a separate company, is not informed of the specific details of their domain roadmap. The subsidiary also does not track how many of the .blog domains are running WordPress, as the extension is platform agnostic and in use across many different blogging services. </p>\n<p>So far .blog domain customers include both individuals and businesses, including some e-commerce and community sites. Varlese said the main benefit to acquiring a .blog domain is that customers are more likely to get and use a name they always wanted (example.blog), versus settling for a more complicated variation, such as blog.example.com.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Using a blog domain is also a great way to embrace engagement with your community,&#8221; Varlese said. &#8220;In addition to individual and personal bloggers, we also see larger brands using blogs to engage with their customers. Visiting <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.blog\" target=\"_blank\">stackoverflow.blog</a>, for example, is intuitive. The domain lets me know right away what type of content and interaction to expect versus what my expectations would be when prompted to visit stackoverflow.com. Both are equally important and both add value to the customerâ€™s online experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many people purchase a domain just to sit on it for the right time to use it or sell. Greater usage of .blog domains promotes visibility on the web, which is why registrars place value on how many have launched websites using the extension. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Our goal is steady, long-term growth while continuing to increase our usage rates,&#8221; Varlese said. &#8220;We want every .blog domain to resolve to a unique content site or blog. Usage is an important metric for us. It positively contributes to help the new TLD marketplace thrive and grow organically. It is at the forefront of every decision we make, including marketing and rebate programs for our registrars, as well as our dotblogger program, which gives online influencers easy access to all .blog domains, including premium and reserved domains.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The .blog team&#8217;s 100,000 registrations milestone post cites usage stats from Pandalytics, a domains data service, that are not publicly available. </p>\n<p>&#8220;66.5% of .blog domains have a unique website associated with them, compared to an average of 39.3% for both new and legacy TLDs, according to recent research by Daniel Ruzzini-Mejia (co-founder and CSO of DomainsBot Srl, the company behind big-data analysis platform Pandalytics),&#8221; Varlese said. &#8220;Ruzzini-Mejia also found more than 250 .blog domains that use an eCommerce platform.&#8221; </p>\n<p>This is an interesting find in an era where many have claimed that blogs are dead. If the indie web proponents have their way, blogs may have another renaissance yet, and could become the anchors of commerce and identity online. The healthy usage numbers the .blog extension has posted in its first year are a strong indicator that the concept of blogging still holds an important place on the web. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 18:09:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: Adobe to Discontinue Flash Support and Updates in 2020\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73654\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://wptavern.com/adobe-to-discontinue-flash-support-and-updates-in-2020\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3545:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/adobe-flash.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Adobe <a href=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2017/07/adobe-flash-update.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> today that it will discontinue Flash support and updates at the end of 2020. Flash played an important part in the history of the web, inspiring many of the open standards and formats that the web has moved on to embrace.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Given this progress, and in collaboration with several of our technology partners â€“ including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla â€“ Adobe is planning to end-of-life Flash. Specifically, we will stop updating and distributing the Flash Player at the end of 2020 and encourage content creators to migrate any existing Flash content to these new open formats.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Last year most major browsers moved to block Flash, requiring users to enable it manually for sites where they wish to view Flash content. Microsoft, Google, and Mozilla were on deck today with announcements of their own regarding future Flash support. Firefox is the most aggressive with its <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2017/07/25/firefox-roadmap-flash-end-life/\" target=\"_blank\">plan to disable Flash for most users in 2019</a>. Only those running an Extended Support Release will be able to continue using it through the end of 2020 and no version of Firefox will load the plugin after Adobe discontinues security patches.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/saying-goodbye-flash-chrome/\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome is also phasing out support for Flash</a> and plans to remove it completely from the browser toward the end of 2020.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Three years ago, 80 percent of desktop Chrome users visited a site with Flash each day,&#8221; Google Chrome Product Manager Anthony Laforge said. &#8220;Today usage is only 17 percent and continues to decline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This trend reveals that sites are migrating to open web technologies, which are faster and more power-efficient than Flash. Theyâ€™re also more secure, so you can be safer while shopping, banking, or reading sensitive documents.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Microsoft Edge team also <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/07/25/flash-on-windows-timeline/#QKXFIeE23ZSoZLlh.97\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> its plans to phase out Flash from both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer with complete removal from all supported versions of Microsoft Windows by the end of 2020.</p>\n<p>Although <a href=\"http://blog.kongregate.com/html5-is-here/\" target=\"_blank\">HTML5 adoption is growing among game developers</a>, Adobe&#8217;s announcement means major changes for segments of the the gaming, education, and video industries that have not yet migrated to newer, open formats. This news will also make obsolete dozens of WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/flash/\" target=\"_blank\">plugins that were created to upload and display Flash content</a>.</p>\n<p>Adobe&#8217;s announcement was met with thanks and &#8220;good riddance,&#8221; with many calling for an even speedier timeline. Many are also concerned about all the orphaned content and .swf games on the web that Flash&#8217;s disappearance will create. Adobe has received many requests on Twitter for the company to consider open sourcing the old Flash Player codebase for the sake of compatibility and archiving content. Adobe has not officially replied to any of these requests.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 04:01:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"HeroPress: Random Diary Chapters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1992\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"https://heropress.com/essays/random-diary-chapters/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=random-diary-chapters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7835:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/072617-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: WordPress combines people together from all over the world. Maybe WordPress is important after all.\" /><blockquote><p>There goes my hero<br />\nWatch him as he goes<br />\nThere goes my hero<br />\nHe&#8217;s ordinary</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"></div>\n<p>I have no idea what Iâ€™m going to write about. How about people? Ordinary people are heroes to me. People who are willing to help one another. People just like you and me.</p>\n<p>Well, at least like you <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> &#8211; if youâ€™re for some reason reading my diary.</p>\n<h2>Whoâ€™s teaching who</h2>\n<p>I still remember when I build my first website with table layouts while studying math in the University of JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤. Those were the days! But it doesnâ€™t feel like yesterday anymore. More like day before.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless being a math teacher has been the perfect choice for me. Itâ€™s been fun, challenging, and rewarding. Iâ€™ve probably learnt lot more from students than they have from me.</p>\n<p>Heck, they even got me into WordPress when I was taking my ex-students short film course. Was it 2008? Something like that. We needed a website for our short film and had only 1-2 days. Students gave me link to WordPress.com and I was sold. Getting site up and running was easy and fast.</p>\n<p>â€œWell come here and do it yourself!!â€� &#8211; drama class student shouted.</p>\n<p>Thatâ€™s another good lesson Iâ€™ve learnt.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Itâ€™s so easy to give negative feedback (donâ€™t do it like that) without doing anything yourself or giving constructive feedback.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oh boy I still feel ashamed when I judged a book by itâ€™s cover. This time the book cover was a blonde girl asking weird questions with high voice. I was a prison of my prejudice and instantly assumed she must be bad at math. How wrong was I. She was brilliant.</p>\n<p>At least the prison gate is now open if I just understand to walk out.</p>\n<h2>Who am I</h2>\n<p>Sometimes I wonder what other people think of me? Do they think Iâ€™m open minded teacher, or front-developer who cares about accessibility. But does any of that matter? Job title really doesnâ€™t tell anything who I am. Or anybody else.</p>\n<p>But who am I? Iâ€™m not sure how to define me. Iâ€™m no dad or husband. I do have several good traits but there are also demons inside me. Lack of empathy is one of them. And that comes down to this:</p>\n<p>In the end <strong>Iâ€™m a selfish asshole</strong>.</p>\n<p>Itâ€™s okay to be selfish from time to time but itâ€™s not okay to let people down big time when they need me most. Being an ordinary human being is not one of my strengths but Iâ€™ll promise to work on it.</p>\n<h2>Friends will be friends</h2>\n<p>I consider myself lucky. I have lovely parents and two crazy big brothers. And over the years I have made friendships that last forever.</p>\n<p>I hope everybody have a friend who is like a bridge between other friends. Someone who is always organizing something fun: bowling, music gigs, dinners, sports. Someone who is always nice to others and would never hurt a fly.</p>\n<p>I had a friend like that.</p>\n<p>But as a return I couldnâ€™t help him enough. Shadows of life had taken over him. He could not see the light anymore. He died by suicide before christmas 2015.</p>\n<p>Now he canâ€™t fall anymore. He will always be our beloved one and weâ€™ll miss him more than words can express. So many songs reflects to memories we have. For example this Finnish song that I heard exactly one year after his death. (<a href=\"http://lyricstranslate.com/en/rakastettu-beloved.html\">Lyrics in english</a>).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"></div>\n<p>Why is it so much easier to talk about other problems but not your own. Why is it so hard to ask help when you really need it.</p>\n<h2>Life goes on</h2>\n<p>Do I need to say anything. No I don&#8217;t.</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/summer-of-2017-peaceful-mind-after-sauna.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1995\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/summer-of-2017-peaceful-mind-after-sauna.jpg\" alt=\"View of the water form the shore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" /></a>Summer 2017.

People behind it are, they have feelings. I wish more people would remember that when commenting on blog posts, Slack, or other online tools with shitty attitudes.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Being nice and constructive goes a long way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>AtÂ the same time itâ€™s amazing to notice how WordPress combines people together from all over the world. In WordCamps and meetups I have found new friends that really matter. That feels good.</p>\n<p>Maybe WordPress is important after all.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Random Diary Chapters\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Random%20Diary%20Chapters&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Frandom-diary-chapters%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Random Diary Chapters\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Frandom-diary-chapters%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Frandom-diary-chapters%2F&title=Random+Diary+Chapters\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Random Diary Chapters\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/random-diary-chapters/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/072617-150x150.jpg&description=Random Diary Chapters\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Random Diary Chapters\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/random-diary-chapters/\" title=\"Random Diary Chapters\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/random-diary-chapters/\">Random Diary Chapters</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 00:00:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sami Keijonen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:138:\"WPTavern: SiteLock Acquires Patchmanâ€™s Malware and Vulnerability Detection Technology, Expands WordPress Customer Base to 4 Million\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73626\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:140:\"https://wptavern.com/sitelock-acquires-patchmans-malware-and-vulnerability-detection-technology-expands-wordpress-customer-base-to-4-million\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4490:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sitelock-logo.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sitelock.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SiteLock</a>, a website security company, has <a href=\"https://www.sitelock.com/pr/extends-web-security-leadership-patchman-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\">acquired</a> <a href=\"http://patchman.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Patchman</a>, a Dutch security startup that offers automated vulnerability patching and malware removal for hosting providers. Prior to the acquisition SiteLock protected 6 million sites, with 2.2 million of them running on WordPress. The addition of Patchman extends SiteLock&#8217;s customer base to 12 million sites and more than 4 million of those are powered by WordPress.</p>\n<p>Patchman detects vulnerabilities in <a href=\"https://patchman.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200236661-Which-applications-does-Patchman-scan-and-fix-\" target=\"_blank\">a wide range of popular applications</a> and quarantines and patches threats automatically. The quarantine feature neutralizes malicious files by removing them from public access. Patchman supports detection and patching for WordPress 3.x and later.</p>\n<p>Historically, the service has not included patches for plugins but it has applied them on a case-by-case basis for high impact vulnerabilities, including a few found in WP Super Cache, MailPoet, and the open source Genericons font project. The Patchman dashboard allows users to easily track files where vulnerabilities have been detected, view status, and revert patches if necessary.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/patchman-dashboard.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Patchman&#8217;s single focus on hosting providers gives SiteLock the opportunity to offer more options to its hosting partners. With the acquisition, the company is now partering with more than 500 hosting providers, including BlueHost, 1&amp;1, Web.com, InMotion, Melbourne IT, GMO (NTT), and many others.</p>\n<p>&#8220;During our early talks, Patchman was not looking to be acquired and SiteLock wasnâ€™t looking to acquire,&#8221; SiteLock President Neill Feather said. After meeting at the WorldHostingDays show in Rust, Germany in late March this year and at another show in Los Angeles, the companies found they shared similar goals and would be in a better position working together.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It truly was a matter of 1+1=3,&#8221; Feather said. &#8220;Traditionally, SiteLock is very strong in detecting and removing malware for end users. Patchman offers a service tailored specifically to hosting providers and aimed at fixing the security vulnerabilities that hackers exploit to infect websites with malware. By working together we are able to address a wider market and offer a broader solution to the problems that we solve for our customers. We can now attack the problem from multiple angles.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Patchman&#8217;s technology will compliment SiteLock&#8217;s existing security features but the company has not yet decided how it will be incorporated into its security plans for customers. Feather said the team is still jointly building out its future roadmap to give hosts and end customers access to a wider range of products. They are also considering making Patchman&#8217;s detection technology compatible with more products in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Feather could not disclose any specifics on revenue generated by <a href=\"https://wpdistrict.sitelock.com/products/\" target=\"_blank\">SiteLock&#8217;s WordPress security products</a> but approximately 30% of its newly expanded customer base is running on WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What we can say is that weâ€™re heavily invested in the WordPress community and plan on continuing to do so,&#8221; Feather said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited that the increased number of sites we now protect across multiple platforms means we&#8217;ll be able to identify malware and malicious trends more efficiently than we&#8217;ve been able to already, and that&#8217;s good for every end user,&#8221; SiteLock&#8217;s WordPress Evangelist Adam Warner said. &#8220;Secondly, although we already have solutions for our partners, Patchman allows web hosts to offer increased security options for advanced users of their platforms. Being a WordPress guy, I&#8217;m excited about the possibility we now have to extend the capabilities of Patchman to plugins and other WordPress-specific software.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 18:46:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: Watch WordCamp Varna Wapuus Get Designed in Real Time\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73617\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wptavern.com/watch-wordcamp-varna-wapuus-get-designed-in-real-time\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1390:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/wordcamp-varna-wapuus.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The very first <a href=\"https://2017.varna.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Varna</a> will be held September 2-3 at the <a href=\"https://www.ue-varna.bg/en/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Economics</a>.

The appearance of the new editor, codenamed â€œAztec,&#8221; is very similar to the old one but is light years ahead of its predecessor in both speed and reliability. Aaron Douglas, iOS engineer at Automattic, announced the <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/07/24/a-brand-new-editor-for-the-wordpress-mobile-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">open beta for Aztec</a> today with a side-by-side comparison video of the old and new editors. A copy and paste test with 500 paragraphs on iPhone 6s demonstrates Aztec&#8217;s instantaneous response while the old editor takes two-minutes to render the text.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition to better speed and performance, Aztec&#8217;s use of OS-provided text controls makes it possible to offer full support for accessibility technologies like iOSâ€™ VoiceOver and Androidâ€™s TalkBack. It also adds the ability to draft using dictation.</p>\n<p>Aztec introduces a new undo/redo tool at the top of the screen as a quick option for fixing mistakes. It also provides a simpler, more reliable experience using spell check.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/aztec-testing.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Aztec beta is available to all users in the latest updates of the app (8.0 for iOS, 7.8 for Android). After opening the app you will see a popup for enabling the new editor. It can also be toggled on/off by going to Me > App Settings and selecting &#8220;Set the Editor Type.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The mobile team has made it easy to test and give feedback without leaving the app. Tapping the &#8220;beta&#8221; button at the top of the editor will open a &#8220;What&#8217;s New in the Beta&#8221; page with a bug button at the top that you can use to report bugs and send feedback. At the moment, the beta does not support shortcodes or video and WordPress gallery features. Keep in mind that it&#8217;s not 100% ready for use and heavy users of the mobile apps are likely to discover glitches.</p>\n<p>Aztec is open source (GPL 2.0) and packaged as a rich-text editor component in its own GitHub repository (<a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Aztec-iOS\" target=\"_blank\">iOS</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Aztec-Android\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>) so that developers can use it in their own applications and contribute code back to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Quite literally, there is nothing like this out there â€“ every editor we could find uses a web view or has very limited support for any HTML,&#8221; Douglas said. &#8220;Our hope is the Aztec editor is seen as a component that can be used by many iOS and Android apps to provide a rich HTML editing experience. We feel that we could garner a bigger contributor base to the mobile apps simply because this component exists, is free and open, and is super awesome.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The project is a few months behind the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2017/04/08/introducing-the-aztec-mobile-editors/\" target=\"_blank\">schedule published in April</a>, which had open beta targeted for May and the full release for the end of this month. Depending on how well the beta testing period goes, users could see the new Aztec editor included in the mobile apps within the next few months.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 22:59:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"WPTavern: Hamilton: A Free WordPress Portfolio Theme for Photographers, Illustrators, and Designers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=72881\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/hamilton-a-free-wordpress-portfolio-theme-for-photographers-illustrators-and-designers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3787:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/hamilton/\" target=\"_blank\">Hamilton</a> is a new portfolio theme released by Swedish designer and developer <a href=\"http://www.andersnoren.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Anders NorÃ©n</a> during his summer vacation. It was created for photographers, illustrators, designers, and image-heavy blogs. The theme displays portfolio items in a minimal, masonry-style grid with an optional tagline on the front page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-white-black-1.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Hamilton has a pretty simple design at its core, so when it was more or less finished, I decided to add a couple of fun theme options to make it more customizable,&#8221; NorÃ©n said. &#8220;The main one is the Dark Mode. With a click of the mouse in the WordPress Customizer, you can change Hamilton from dark text on a white background to white text on a dark background.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Customizer also includes a few other helpful options for portfolio sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set a custom background image or color</li>\n<li>Replace the navigation toggle in the header with the Primary Menu on desktop</li>\n<li>Change two-column default post grid display to three columns on desktop</li>\n<li>Display titles in the post previews</li>\n<li>Add a title to front page when it&#8217;s set to display latest posts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The theme is beautifully responsive to various devices and screen sizes.

It gives users the option to add a simple resume to their portfolios, without having to add a plugin. The template uses basic HTML for formatting with h1 header tags, horizontal rules, and unordered lists. The template could use a bit more documentation, since not all users are familiar with HTML, but it&#8217;s a useful addition for simple portfolio sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/resume-template.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Check out a <a href=\"http://andersnoren.se/themes/hamilton/\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> along with the <a href=\"http://andersnoren.se/themes/hamilton/style-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">style guide</a> to see the theme in action.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/hamilton/\" target=\"_blank\">Hamilton</a> is Anders NorÃ©n&#8217;s 15th theme approved for the WordPress Theme Directory.

Over the course of a few months he started going deeper into learning about writing WordPress plugins and produced <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/\" target=\"_blank\">Members</a>, a role management plugin for WordPress. The first major overhaul of the plugin came in 2015 with version 1.0&#8217;s expansion of features and a new UI for editing roles.</p>\n<p>Members has built up a user base of more than 100,000 active installs since it first <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/09/17/members-wordpress-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">launched in 2009</a>. Tadlock estimates that over the last couple years, 40% of <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Hybrid</a> customers are primarily there for support and small tweaks to the Members plugin. He decided it was time to begin investing more in the plugin and its community.</p>\n<p>Tadlock released <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/weblog/members-version-2-0\" target=\"_blank\">Members 2.0</a> this week. The plugin manages core WordPress capabilities but 2.0 adds the ability for plugins to register custom capabilities. The labels for the capabilities can be internationalized so users can manage the plugin in their own languages in human-readable form.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-human-caps.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also adds the ability to use the WordPress editor for writing custom post error messages, making it easy to direct visitors to registration or other important information regarding access to the content.</p>\n<p>Members 2.0 lets users add multiple roles when creating a new user from the Add User screen. It also introduces the ability to bulk add or remove roles from users, even when multiple roles have been enabled.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-bulk-users.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This version of the plugin serves some of its data using the WP REST API and a new setting was added to authenticate users who are accessing the REST API endpoints. This protects content from being exposed on sites that have the &#8220;private site&#8221; setting enabled. Tadlock plans to write a tutorial about what he has learned in integrating the REST API with the plugin.</p>\n<h3>Tadlock Aims to Monetize Members with Add-Ons, Renews Efforts to Develop a Community of Add-On Developers</h3>\n<p>Members 2.0 introduces a new Settings screen that ties in with Tadlock&#8217;s future plans to monetize the plugin. The new screen includes a view for add-ons. Tadlock has two add-ons available currently and has written an API for third-party developers to register their own add-ons to be visible on this screen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-addons.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The plan is to create some small add-on plugins,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;There&#8217;s already two:  <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members-role-levels\" target=\"_blank\">Members &#8211; Role Levels</a>, which is paid, and <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members-role-hierarchy\" target=\"_blank\">Members &#8211; Role Hierarchy</a>, which I was hired to build and was allowed to release to the community for free. I&#8217;ve got a few small plugins like those in mind that&#8217;ll be in a lower price range.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock also plans to release a more robust version of the &#8220;Content Permissions&#8221; feature as another add-on. He has received numerous feature requests from users over the years about what they would like to see in this plugin. The add-on will offer a variety of different ways to show/hide content.</p>\n<p>I asked Tadlock if he has considered building payment gateway add-ons so users can charge for memberships. He said the idea is on the table.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m going to build those or someone else,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve mentioned it to some other developers. It would be a good place to start building add-ons.&#8221; His current setup uses Easy Digital Downloads with a couple of plugins to bridge it with Members and ThemeHybrid.com.</p>\n<p>A plugin like Members has the potential to have a large, third-party ecosystem of plugins for payments and additional features, but Tadlock was focused on other projects during the first few years after it launched.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t actively pursued the add-on angle,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Instead, I focused more on themes during most of that time. Now, I&#8217;m focusing more on plugin development. It&#8217;s my fault for not nurturing a community of add-on developers, which is something I&#8217;m trying to do more of now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock said many of the developers he knows are working with Members because they like that it gives them a solid foundation to build on for client work. He hopes to persuade some of them to release some of that code back as commercial add-ons or free plugins in the WordPress plugin directory.</p>\n<p>Since launching the plugin eight years ago, Tadlock has aimed to make it behave as if it were a natural part of WordPress. At its core, Members is a role and capability management plugin and not a one-size-fits all membership plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more or less a UI over what you could do with code already,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Most of all, it tries not to get in your way. Every membership site has its own unique needs. It&#8217;s tough building something that suits everyone.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;d rather have that foundation of Members just exposing the roles/caps system with third-party add-ons that suit various users&#8217; needs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other membership plugins often try to please everyone or pigeon-hole everything into their custom system.

Unfortunately, this <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-disable-visual-editor-in-the-text-widget/\">caused issues</a> for those who use Custom HTML as the Visual editor often strips out portions of the code.</p>\n<p>WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/#beta-and-rc\">4.8.1 Beta 1</a> is available for testing and addresses this problem by including a dedicated Custom HTML widget.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For advanced users or any user who needs to paste in HTML snippets, there is now a dedicated &#8216;Custom HTML&#8217; widget that is specifically for adding arbitrary HTML to your sidebar,&#8221; Weston Ruter, said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This widget will retain the application of the <code>widget_text</code> filters, in addition to having a new dedicated <code>widget_custom_html_content</code> filter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For use cases that involve adding content to your sidebar, the Text widget will continue to feature the same Visual editing interface that the post editor has (TinyMCE).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Users who access Text widgets that have Custom HTML in WordPress 4.8.1, will see a note at the top of the widget that suggests using the Custom HTML widget.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>If a user pastes or types HTML into a text widget with the Visual editor active, WordPress displays an Admin Pointer suggesting that they use the Text tab instead or use the Custom HTML widget.</p>\n<img />Text Widget Admin Pointer\n<p>The Custom HTML widget works similar to the Text widget in WordPress 4.7 and below.</p>\n<img />Custom HTML Widget\n<p>Sites that have existing Text widgets containing custom HTML that may be modified by the Visual editor, are opened in a legacy mode.</p>\n<p>Legacy mode retains the old Text widget interface, including the checkbox on whether or not to automatically add paragraphs. This change prevents the Visual editor from altering code.</p>\n<p>Ruter says the ideal way to test these improvements is to install it on a staging site that has Text widgets containing HTML and are known to be problematic in WordPress 4.8.Â After upgrading, check to see if the widgets open in legacy mode.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.8.1 is scheduled to be released on August 1st.

So far the GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191\" target=\"_blank\">issue</a> has received 627 &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; emoji and 66 comments from concerned React users who are hoping for a change in licensing.</p>\n<p>Many respondents on the thread said that ASF&#8217;s decision affects their organizations&#8217; ability to continue using React in projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Apache CouchDB and others will switch away from React if we have to,&#8221; CouchDB committer Robert Newson <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-315596902\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d rather not, it&#8217;s a lot of work for no real gain, but we don&#8217;t have a choice. Changing license can be simple (RocksDB completed that change in a day).&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;My team, at LinkedIn, is also having legal troubles using React for our internal projects,&#8221; LinkedIn software Denis Ivanov <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316500996\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;We would love to see a change on this front.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Software developer Clark Evans <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-315607798\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on how React&#8217;s current licensing might affect medical research institutes, and suggested that Facebook consider an Apache 2.0 license because it includes equitable patent grants.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Since U.S. based universities rely upon patent licensing as part of their legislatively mandated technology transfer initiatives, they are growing far more cautious in their due diligence. For this reason, at some universities, software written with React may be shunned. Existing projects using React software may be asked to remove the React software software dependency. Please strongly consider this proposal, since our RexDB work is used at major universities, we do not wish to rework to use a React alternative.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Several participants in the discussion commented that they would like to use React but the licensing makes it impossible for their companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other large companies such as mine (Adobe) can&#8217;t use React, Pop, etc. for the very same reason,&#8221; Corey Lucier <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316046522\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d love to participate in the project, contribute to each, etc. but Facebook&#8217;s heavy-handed PATENTS clause is a showstopper.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even mid-size companies like mine (ViaSat) are starting to disallow the use of Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;open-source&#8217; projects for this reason,&#8221; software developer Aaron Yoshitake <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316102045\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d like to build React web and native apps, but it seems that any sensible legal department will recommend against agreeing to Facebook&#8217;s asymmetric patent grant.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Internal Discussions Continue at Facebook, Re-Licensing Issue has been Escalated to Engineering Directors</h3>\n<p>Dan Abramov, co-author of Redux, Create React App, and React Hot Loader, shared with participants that Facebook is having internal discussions about the re-licensing issue but cautioned them to temper their optimism. He returned to throw some ice on the conversation, which has grown more heated over the past few days, when he said it could only remain an open discussion if everyone involved remains civil. Many participants are concerned about the future of the React-based software that they have already invested thousands of hours of work into.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand that everyone is frustrated about this issue,&#8221; Abramov <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316223034\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;Personally I am just as frustrated to spend time, energy, and emotional wellbeing on legal mumbo jumbo that is preventing people from using React. I would much prefer to spend this time on working together to make it better.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But the reality of this situation is that the maintainers of React (people like me that youâ€™re interacting on the issue tracker) are not the ones making these decisions. Each of us is doing what we can to show different perspectives on this issue to the people who can make those decisions, and we appreciate your feedback too. But we can only keep discussion open if everyone stays civil and respectful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Abramov also pointed out in a follow-up update that a bug tracker isn&#8217;t the best avenue for a legal discussion, especially since most participants are software developers and not lawyers. Many have mistaken the thread as a way to communicate with Facebook but there are just a handful of software developers who are representing the React community&#8217;s concerns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have heard you very well, and we have passed on your concerns,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;But repeating the same points over and over in different threads does not help move this forward, and creates a lot of noise and stress for the maintainers who are already empathetic to your cause.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several participants expressed frustration that the React community cannot participate in the discussions more directly. However, as React is both an open source project and a product of Facebook, the company&#8217;s leadership has the last word on licensing issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand that software developers like us are not the best people to discuss legal details,&#8221; software consultant Erik Doernenburg <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316318170\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;However, wouldn&#8217;t the logical consequence be that the Facebook Legal team, who make such decisions, become active in this forum? Shouldn&#8217;t it be possible that all relevant details pertaining to a piece of open source software are discussed in the open? It is incredibly frustrating to have such an important aspect of open software discussed behind closed doors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not known whether Facebook is considering another change to its Patents grant or a complete re-licensing. Participants in the discussion are also concerned about other Facebook open source projects like GraphQL, Relay, React Native, and Flow, which share the same BSD+Patents License and are widely used by the open source community.</p>\n<p>Dan Abramov left an <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316739812\" target=\"_blank\">update</a> today to let the community know that no resolution is available this week. However, the update seemed more positive than the first one, which discouraged participants from being optimistic about a change.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to point out that there is a real momentum behind this discussion internally,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;There are going to be more meetings next week escalating this up to the engineering directors. As you imagine they are quite busy, so this is taking more time than we thought.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Again, I canâ€™t promise you any specific conclusion, and there is no clarity on where this will land. But please know there are people working on getting your voice heard.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 22:37:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 282 â€“ Talking WooCommerce with Cody Landefeld\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=73448&preview=true&preview_id=73448\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-282-talking-woocommerce-with-cody-landefield\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3386:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me/\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/codyL\">Cody Landefeld</a>, Senior web strategist and founder of <a href=\"https://modeeffect.com/\">Mode Effect</a>.

I was almost forbidden to do things I didn’t really love. My parents insisted on trying things and finding that deep passion. But I didn’t have to search and try. I always knew what I’d be when I grow up. As long as I remember, there was no doubt. A classical musician When I was 8 my mom took me to local music school for entrance examination. I was in! Oh, joy! Finally I was learning to play and sing, to read and write this new language. Italian. Oh, music scores too! There was a whole new world that my parents, or anyone in my family, didn’t know anything about and I was stepping into it. I was doing just fine in it.. and I couldn’t live outside of it. As time passed, I finished elementary and high music school, went to music Academy, almost finished it and then my mother died. It was 2003. Two weeks later I found out I was pregnant. There was no time for grief and I couldn’t feel the joy. I just switched off and turned to the facts: I became a mom and a wife and I needed a job. And what a job did I found. An opera prompter. Opera Prompter! God, I love that job. Every second of it for ten years. I was yelling at singers, singing, conducting, traveling, laughing and crying. My Italian was significantly improved. Working time was great – so much free time to be a mom, study for Academy, get a hobby… Opera prompter’s hobby In 2007 I was administrator in one English speaking forum with focus on software and hardware topics. It helped me to significantly improve my English. And my tech knowledge. Which was close to none when I registered. As one of administrators, occasionally I had to tweak site here and there. It was great! There was this code and when I would change something in code it would show on the site. Neat! I loved reading those files, finding patterns and parts written in humanly understandable forms. Later I learned those were called loops and conditionals. Also later I learned that this language is called PHP and that many other languages for building websites exist. Forum script was phpBB3. I was never a gamer. Never understood the point of game, besides finishing it. I guess PHP was to me what games are to passionate gamers. Like a puzzle or sudoku. At the same time my marriage was turning from bad into worse and in the beginning of 2008 I finally decided it was enough. We were working on Mozart’s â€œDon Giovanniâ€� in Theater. I remember this so clearly because my divorce was just turning from bad into worse. Those few months lasted for centuries after which I still needed a lot of time to recover what’s left of my self-esteem. My complete mental and emotional health was destroyed after years of domestic violence. 2009 was important year for me. The cognition of possibility to have local server on my own machine and test everything before executing it on live site turned out to be very helpful. In October I needed a blog script and friend recommended WordPress. It was 2.9 version. It didn’t really work well but everyone was writing about it. There were at least 5 new tutorials on various blogs every day. I was digesting them every morning with my first coffee. The ones I really liked I even reproduced in my shiny new localhost. Soon enough I developed a local monster with different widgets on each page, future posts archive, post series done with custom fields and God knows whatnot. This WordPress was slowly taking over my free time. Every second of it. So, the WordPress it is One day a friend of mine asked me to build him a website for his ensemble. And for money. Money? I never thought of getting money for this. This was too good of a hobby. But he’s a friend so I did it. Then another friend showed up with the same request. And another.. I became freelance WordPress developer before I could even understand what was happening. It wasn’t really a favor to friends any more. I was a single mom with mortgage. My daughter was in primary school, life costs became serious while the art-and-culture salary was silently and regularly reduced. I was freelancing every single minute I could. Sleeping was luxury I could afford on weekends. My dad was helping me tremendously. He was babysitting during theater’s rehearsals and performances in the evenings. When I’d get home, my daughter was sleeping, tomorrow’s meals cooked, dishes done and shinning.. I could go on like this but it was uncertain for how long. In the summer of 2013 I was recovering from what was supposed to be routine gallbladder surgery and what nearly cost me life. Almost fully operational, I was getting ready for next roller coaster known as a mix of school year, freelancing and theater’s season. Then my father died. Suddenly. In an accident. Oh, this screaming silence.. I couldn’t think. Or breathe. For months. I needed someone to put the roller coaster on pause. Just.. Just a short one. To take a breathe. But there was no one. I was all alone with a 9 years old child who had to grow up fast. I had to grow up fast. All of a sudden I realized that I can not afford a single mistake any more. I can not be ill, get in debts, lose job. Or mind. I was the only one I could count on. In 2014 my theater salary got reduced once again. And again in following year. 30% in total. For ten years it never covered all of my monthly expenses but this was ridiculous. It was a time for me to stop playing it safe and see what I’m made of. That was probably the most difficult decision I have ever made. A heart breaking one. Stop being musician. So I quit being Opera Prompter and started working as a full time WordPress developer. Well, hello, World! I didn’t really know for which wage level my knowledge was. For years I was the only WordPress developer I knew in person. The rest were all online superstars I was learning from. So I started as a shy medior and the only WordPress developer in agency. It turns out that, for this agency needs, I was senior and soon enough I was organizing and leading development processes for new projects. From the business point of view repeating similar projects makes you “niche expert”. I do understand that. But, as many other developers out there, I don’t like repeating the same tasks or projects. Not even once. I missed variety which led me to become more active contributor on wordpress.org. For years I was just contributing to codex here and there and never really thought about all the people behind WordPress. In my vague image, they were a bunch of really great developers and they were doing just fine. I was learning from them so I could not possibly help them. I would just be on their way. However, in my attempt to find something interesting to keep my mind amused with, I came upon Slack url for communication between contributors on WordPress project. What a crowd! And not just developers – everyone! Doing all kinds of different bits, and all important. How odd. WordPress is not like any other open source community I saw before. So much more open and inviting! I remember reading through channels and thinking: “I could do this”, “Oh, I’d love to learn that”, “This person is funny”.. I’m gonna stick. Antisocial extrovert in a more open open source community No matter how I tried, and I did try, I’m just not a people person. Among other antisocial treats, over the years I have developed a heavy dark humor which, more often than not, due to lack of social interactions I reveal in a completely wrong way. But these people seem not to mind so I thought to give it a try with them. Don’t get me wrong, Code of Conduct is extremely important in WordPress community. No community wants bullies. But rare communities accept social weirdos and misfits. And this one doesn’t just accept them, it makes them feel like fits. That was a nice change. I started attending local Meetups, even gave a talk on contributing to Theme Review team after which I was invited to join Toptal platform as a freelance developer. My social adventure got me volunteering on WordCamp Belgrade and WordCamp Europe in Paris. I must admit there were “too many people at the same time” moments but there were lots of ways to stay involved with controlled dose of human interactions. I chose volunteering at Experts bar and it worked out just great. I really loved all the hugs though. Today I try to keep my focus on just a few channels in make WordPress slack and my contribution wish list regularly updated. One can have only so many hours in a day. Most often you’ll find me in #docs and #core-docs channels, doing various stuff with Documentation team.  The Questions Among all the questions I get about my professional path, the most commons are “How come you made such a huge change from music to web development?“, “Did you go to school to become a developer?” and “Do you miss being musician?“. Answer to the first question is quite easy: “Being musician and writing code are pretty much the same. They both require the same parts of your mental struggle and make you go through the same emotional tortures and enlightenments.” The second question, however, is a bit more difficult to answer. In the light of the first answer, I could say that I was exposed to the required way of thinking. Practicing an instrument 6 hours per day for over a decade does teach you a couple of things about commitment. World of classical music is a world of magnificent talents and varieties which touches you all the way to the humble self where you find appreciation for being able to feel this way. Personally, I believe this is extremely important for developer – to be humble and grateful to person who helped them find this humbleness. No, I don’t have a formal developer’s education. It doesn’t seem to prevent me from being developer. And no, I don’t miss being musician. Because I never stopped being one. I listen to classical music while I code and play piano when I have a difficult programming problem to solve. Feels so natural. I’d like to say that everything turned out pretty good at the end but, as my father used to say: “Life is the greatest screenplay writer” and my life seems to be the witty one too. In expectation of future turns I’d recommend Beethoven’s Symphony No.7, II movement, some very loud laughs and lots of WordPress loops.

The login flow has been completely redesigned to provide a more unified experience for connecting both self-hosted and WordPress.com-hosted sites. These flows were completely separate in the past and users were often confused about which one to select. The new design provides fewer opportunities for friction when logging in, an experience that likely determines many users’ first impressions of the app. Self-hosted login on mobile apps “As we reimagined the login experience, there were a few key principles guiding us: keep it simple, minimize the distinction between a site hosted at WordPress.com versus somewhere else, and avoid anything that might be too clever,” Automattic mobile lead Eric Johnson said. Users can now connect new sites by entering the URL and the mobile apps will automatically detect if the site is hosted on WordPress.com or not. The new login flow ferries users on to the next step based on what kind of site is being connected. This is available in version 8.0 of WordPress for Android and version 8.2 of WordPress for iOS. The new login experience emphasizes the ease of using magic links for logging into WordPress.com. If the user enters and email address, the app will generate an authentication link and send it via email. This allows users to login without having to remember or enter a password.  If a user is entering the world of WordPress for the first time through the mobile apps, the new login experience also offers a short tour of the some of the features included in the app. These include WordPress.com features such as notifications, Stats, and the Reader. The apps, despite being marketed as the official WordPress mobile apps, are a product of Automattic and include a commercial upgrade path for WordPress.com services. The idea of the apps functioning as a gateway to help the greater WordPress ecosystem gain more users (and eventually see some graduate to self-hosted sites), no longer seems credible now that WordPress.com has entered the hosting space by allowing its customers to tap into third-party plugins and themes. The updated login experience, while more convenient for users, continues to blur the line between self-hosted and WordPress.com-hosted sites. WordPress for Android and iOS used to have their own separate blogs but all of the news is now funneled through WordPress.com’s news blog and the @WordPressiOS and @WPAndroid Twitter accounts seemed to have been abandoned in favor of marketing updates through WordPress.com. In the past, many in the WordPress community have asked why the apps are not called the WordPress.com mobile apps, since they include features that are not central to the core publishing experience for self-hosted users. Last year when I interviewed Maxime Biais, one of Automatticâ€™s mobile engineers, he said the team had considered splitting the product into two apps. â€œWe considered having both WordPress and WordPress.com apps, but we rejected this because it doesnâ€™t make it more clear,â€� Bias said. â€œItâ€™s probably even more ambiguous when someone searches the Play Store for ‘WordPress’ or ‘Blog’ and finds both WordPress and WordPress.com apps.â€� Now that that mobile apps have become a direct pipeline for new WordPress.com hosting customers, it may be time to re-visit the consideration of splitting the apps into two distinct products: one for WordPress.com’s commercial interests and one that officially represents the open source WordPress project for self-hosted users without any corporate interests. If the project’s official mobile apps are a key part of new users’ onboarding experience, they should accurately represent the software as an independent platform that can be hosted with and extended by any number of free and commercial products in the WordPress ecosystem.\'>WPTavern: WordPress Mobile Apps Updated with a New Login Experience</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-to-experiment-with-a-community-bazaar\' title=\'In addition to taking place in a new location this year, WordCamp US will have a Community Bazaar. An area will be set aside in the venue allowing those chosen to showcase their WordPress communities. Raquel Landefeld, Randy Hicks, and Dustin Mezo are organizing the Bazaar. Landefeld says the idea was inspired by the people who make up the WordPress Community. “We recognize that some local WordPress communities are thriving and some are just getting started,” she said. “What better way to help build community then by showcasing our local communities to the world. The thought is that smaller, newer, and communities just in their infancy, will be inspired with fresh ideas and or how-tos from the bigger and more established WordPress communities.” The idea is similar to that of a science fair where each community chosen will have a space to highlight why theirs is awesome. The purpose of the event is to inspire growth while providing an opportunity for communities to learn from each other. There will also be metrics shared such as, number of meetup and WordCamp attendees, meetups per month, and unique qualities pertaining to the local groups. The organizing team is looking for the inside scoop on local communities. “This is all about you and your local WordPress community,” Landefeld said. “This is your time to shine. Why is your community different, special, or amazing? Be showy! Forget modesty. Let your communityâ€™s awesomeness be a tool to inspire other WP communities just getting started or striving.” Last year saw record growth for WordPress community events. In 2016, more than 62,566 people attended a local meetup in 58 countries and about one-third of those were new members. A total of 115 WordCamps were hosted in 41 different countries. Those interested in participating in the Bazaar are encouraged to fill out the following submission form and provide as many details as possible.\'>WPTavern: WordCamp US to Experiment With A Community Bazaar</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wptavern.com/maekit-acquires-wp-remote-plans-to-add-cloud-based-backup-services\' title=\' maekit, a cloud-based platform that handles the business aspect of web design, has acquired WP Remote from Human Made. Two years after Human Made began searching for a buyer, maekit purchased WP Remote to integrate it with the company’s existing platform that caters to designers managing multiple clients. “WP Remote had remained a much-loved product with its users and despite receiving no ongoing development it had remained an iconic plugin in the WordPress community,” Human Made CEO Tom Willmot said. maekit took over WP Remote operations in March after closing the deal. According to maekit CEO Matt Holme, the company inherited 20,000 users with 120,000 WordPress websites. His team has maintained WP Remote in its original platform for the past few months before integrating it into maekit last week. WP Remote has offered unlimited, free WordPress site management (updating core, plugins, and themes with a single click) since 2010. It hasn’t received ongoing development for several years, but maekit plans to add backup features that will make bring it more up to speed with competitors like MangeWP, MainWP, and InfiniteWP. “We definitely plan to keep WP Remote free and expand its features,” Holme said. “Specifically we are looking at offering easy-to-manage cloud-based backup services. For example, hook up your Dropbox (or any other popular cloud based storage system) and schedule regular backups of your WP websites.” maekit’s acquisition of WP Remote gives the company’s customers the ability to deploy WordPress sites with one click and manage client sites and domains through a unified, white-labeled invoicing and payment system. The company has rolled out a few long-overdue bug fixes to WP Remote and Holme says the rest of maekit is functional but still technically in a closed beta mode. “Our revenue model revolves around direct sale hosting plans and also reselling integrated hosting plans for other leading global hosting providers,” Holme said. “We are refining the free invoicing and payment processing system built into maekit so that a maekit / WP Remote user can deploy a new hosted WP and charge their client a recurring monthly fee and retain the mark up they add on top of our base hosting prices as profit. This means literally no out of pocket expense for maekit / WP Remote users.” Although maekit’s one-click deployment service supports many popular CMS’s and e-commmerce platforms, including WordPress, Opencart, Drupal, Magento, and Joomla, Holme said the vast majority of the company’s customers are running on WordPress. Acquiring WP Remote brings a host of valuable new features to maekit’s customer base. maekit’s built-in client billing features, customized for freelancers and agencies, are what Holme says will differentiate the company from its competitors in the WordPress space. “I have a great deal of respect for these other WP management platforms and feel the size of the WP market means there is opportunity for all to succeed,” Holme said. “With the features of maekit also including new website deployment, invoicing, payment processing and client management, our platform is unique from the others.”\'>WPTavern: maekit Acquires WP Remote, Plans to Add Cloud-Based Backup Services</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-8-0-introduces-5-new-blocks-categories-text-columns-shortcode-audio-and-video\' title=\'Gutenberg 0.8.0 was released over the weekend with five new blocks, major improvements to existing blocks, and support for more publishing features that have been missing from the new editor’s sidebar. The release also carries out the controversial decision to remove the opt-in usage tracking code from the plugin. The new Categories block can be found under the Widgets section, as it’s output is based on the existing categories widget. The default display is an alphabetized list of categories, but the block settings include options to display as a dropdown, show post counts, and show hierarchy.  A new Text Columns block allows users to split text content into multiple columns. The settings include a sliding scale for selecting 2-4 columns.  Contributors are calling the Text Block “an initial exploration” of multiple columns for text-only content. Depending on testing, it may not be the implementation that ends up landing in the plugin permanently. “We’ve been over how difficult it is to get columns right, and also how already today third parties can build this,” Joen Asmussen said. “We may very well want an entirely different implementation than this one. But perhaps it’s good to get this in now and test it. Perhaps this can help inform how a better column implementation can work down the road. In fact we might want to merge this block in now, only to take it back out later again, same as the Cover Text block. For that reason, I think it’d be good to test this.” The new Video and Audio blocks are geared towards inserting files that have already been uploaded to the media library. However, I found the text on the video block to be confusing. If I was new to WordPress and didn’t understand how oEmbed works, I would be clicking inside the video block to figure out where to paste the URL.  The new Audio and Video blocks mirror the same kind of functionality that users have experienced when adding images to their sites. In the future, contributors may introduce more features to the audio block, such as additional playback types and looping, but the first iteration includes just the basics. Gutenberg 0.8.0 adds resizing handlers to the existing Image Block, making it easy for users to insert and quickly resize an image. If you review the GitHub ticket for this feature, it’s clear that it was not easy to implement. Image resizing has gone through several changes and may have more down the road, especially as it pertains to the behavior of the caption. Ultimately, the caption field should not be wider than the image so that the two are placed together.  This release introduces a post formats selector to the post settings sidebar. It includes a suggestion based on what blocks are in use in the post. One participant on the ticket noted that the suggestion gives too much importance to the post formats selection and might be confusing to users. The suggestion persists, despite a user switching the format to the one suggested. This is because Gutenberg cannot detect if it was explicitly set by the user or if the user selected the suggestion. “I happen to agree with you: post formats should go away,” Joen Asmussen said. “In fact part of the genesis of blocks as a concept is to provide a better interface than what post formats did. So the post format selector here is strictly a back-compat thing.”  Gutenberg contributors have also updated the design document for the project, offering more clarity on their goals and concepts they are using to build the editor: Ultimately, the vision for Gutenberg is to make it much easier to author rich content. Through ensuring good defaults, wrapping and bundling advanced layout options blocks, and making the most important actions immediately available, authoring content with WordPress should be accessible to anyone. The idea is to simplify content creation for users so that they only have to learn one interface – the block interface.

This was true when Joost wrote his original <a href=\"https://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress SEO</a> article in 2008 (updated every few months) and it&#8217;s still true today, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t improve it further! This plugin is written from the ground up by Joost de Valk and his team at <a href=\"https://yoast.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast</a> to improve your site&#8217;s SEO on <em>all</em> needed aspects. While this <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast SEO plugin</a> goes the extra mile to take care of all the technical optimization, more on that below, it first and foremost helps you write better content.  Yoast SEO forces you to choose a focus keyword when you&#8217;re writing your articles, and then makes sure you use that focus keyword everywhere.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Premium Support</strong><br />\n  The Yoast team does not always provide active support for the Yoast SEO plugin on the WordPress.org forums. One-on-one email support is available to people who bought the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo-premium/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Premium Yoast SEO plugin</a> only.<br />\n  Note that the Premium SEO plugin has several extra features too, including the option to have multiple focus keywords and a redirect manager, so it might be well worth your investment!</p>\n<p>You should also check out the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/local-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast Local SEO</a>, <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast News SEO</a> and <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/video-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast Video SEO</a> extensions to Yoast SEO. These of course come with support too.</p>\n<p><strong>Bug Reports</strong><br />\n  Bug reports for Yoast SEO are <a href=\"https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo\" rel=\"nofollow\">welcomed on GitHub</a>. Please note GitHub is <em>not</em> a support forum, and issues that aren&#8217;t properly qualified as bugs will be closed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Write better content with Yoast SEO</h4>\n<p>Using the snippet preview, you can see a rendering of what your post or page will look like in the search results, whether your title is too long or too short, and whether your meta description makes sense in the context of a search result. This way the plugin will help you not only increase rankings but also increase the click through rate for organic search results.</p>\n<h4>Page Analysis</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugins <a href=\"https://yoast.com/content-seo-wordpress-linkdex/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Page Analysis</a> functionality checks simple things you&#8217;re bound to forget. It checks, for instance, if you have images in your post and whether they have an alt tag containing the focus keyword for that post. It also checks whether your posts are long enough, whether you&#8217;ve written a meta description and if that meta description contains your focus keyword, if you&#8217;ve used any subheadings within your post, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>The plugin also allows you to write meta titles and descriptions for all your category, tag and custom taxonomy archives, giving you the option to further optimize those pages.</p>\n<p>Combined, this plugin makes sure that your content is the type of content search engines will love!</p>\n<h4>Technical WordPress Search Engine Optimization</h4>\n<p>While out of the box WordPress is pretty good for SEO, it needs some tweaks here and there. This Yoast SEO plugin guides you through some of the settings needed, for instance by reminding you to enable pretty permalinks. But it also goes beyond that, by automatically optimizing and inserting the meta tags and link elements that Google and other search engines like so much:</p>\n<h4>Meta &amp; Link Elements</h4>\n<p>With the Yoast SEO plugin you can control which pages Google shows in its search results and which pages it doesn&#8217;t show. By default, it will tell search engines to index all of your pages, including category and tag archives, but to only show the first pages in the search results. It&#8217;s not very useful for a user to end up on the third page of your &#8220;personal&#8221; category, right?</p>\n<p>WordPress itself only shows canonical link elements on single pages, but Yoast SEO makes it output canonical link elements everywhere. Google has recently announced they would also use <code>rel=\"next\"</code> and <code>rel=\"prev\"</code> link elements in the <code>head</code> section of your paginated archives. This plugin adds those automatically. See <a href=\"https://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a> for more info.</p>\n<h4>XML Sitemaps</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin has the most advanced XML Sitemaps functionality in any WordPress plugin. Once you check the box, it automatically creates XML sitemaps and notifies Google &amp; Bing of the sitemaps&#8217; existence. These XML sitemaps include the images in your posts &amp; pages too, so that your images may be found better in the search engines too.</p>\n<p>These XML Sitemaps will even work on large sites, because of how they&#8217;re created, using one index sitemap that links to sub-sitemaps for each 1,000 posts. They will also work with custom post types and custom taxonomies automatically, while giving you the option to remove those from the XML sitemap should you wish to.</p>\n<p>Because of using <a href=\"https://yoast.com/xsl-stylesheet-xml-sitemap/\" rel=\"nofollow\">XSL stylesheets for these XML Sitemaps</a>, the XML sitemaps are easily readable for the human eye too, so you can spot things that shouldn&#8217;t be in there.</p>\n<h4>RSS Optimization</h4>\n<p>Are you being outranked by scrapers? Instead of cursing at them, use them to your advantage! By automatically adding a link to your RSS feed pointing back to the original article, you&#8217;re telling the search engine where they should be looking for the original. This way, the Yoast SEO plugin increases your own chance of ranking for your chosen keywords and gets rid of scrapers in one go!</p>\n<h4>Breadcrumbs</h4>\n<p>If your theme is compatible, and themes based on for instance Genesis or by WooThemes often are, you can use the built-in Breadcrumbs functionality. This allows you to create an easy navigation that is great for both users and search engines, and will support the search engines in understanding the structure of your site.</p>\n<p>Making your theme compatible isn&#8217;t hard either, check <a href=\"https://kb.yoast.com/kb/implement-wordpress-seo-breadcrumbs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">these instructions</a>.</p>\n<h4>Edit your .htaccess and robots.txt file</h4>\n<p>Using the built-in file editor, you can edit your WordPress blog&#8217;s <code>.htaccess</code> and <code>robots.txt</code> file, giving you direct access to the two most powerful files, from an SEO perspective, in your WordPress install.</p>\n<h4>Social Integration</h4>\n<p>SEO and Social Media are heavily intertwined. That&#8217;s why this plugin also comes with a Facebook OpenGraph implementation and will soon also support Google+ sharing tags.</p>\n<h4>Multi-Site Compatible</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin, unlike some others, is fully Multi-Site compatible. The XML Sitemaps work fine in all setups and you even have the option, in the Network settings, to copy the settings from one blog to another, or make blogs default to the settings for a specific blog.</p>\n<h4>Import &amp; Export functionality</h4>\n<p>If you have multiple blogs, setting up plugins like this one on all of them might seem like a daunting task. Except that it&#8217;s not, because what you can do is simple: you set up the plugin once. You then export your settings and simply import them on all your other sites. It&#8217;s that simple!</p>\n<h4>Import functionality for other WordPress SEO plugins</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve used All In One SEO Pack or HeadSpace2 before using this plugin, you might want to import all your old titles and descriptions. You can do that easily using the built-in import functionality. There&#8217;s also import functionality for some of the older Yoast plugins, like Robots Meta and RSS footer.</p>\n<p>Should you have a need to import from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO, or from a theme like Genesis or Thesis, you can use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-data-transporter/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SEO Data Transporter</a> plugin, which will easily convert your SEO meta data from and to a whole set of plugins like Platinum SEO, SEO Ultimate, Greg&#8217;s High Performance SEO, and themes like Headway, Hybrid, WooFramework, Catalyst etc.</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://yoast.com/all-in-one-seo-pack-migration/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this migration guide</a> if you still have questions about migrating from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO.</p>\n<h4>Yoast SEO Plugin in your Language!</h4>\n<p>Currently a huge translation project is underway, translating Yoast SEO in as much as 24 languages.

Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, WooCommerce is the worldâ€™s favorite eCommerce solution that gives both store owners and developers complete control.</p>\n<p>With endless flexibility and access to hundreds of free and premium WordPress extensions, WooCommerce now powers 30% of all online stores &#8212; more than any other platform.</p>\n<iframe class=\'youtube-player\' type=\'text/html\' width=\'640\' height=\'390\' src=\'https://www.youtube.com/embed/1KahlicghaE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent\' allowfullscreen=\'true\' style=\'border:0;\'></iframe>\n<h4>Sell anything, anywhere</h4>\n<p>With WooCommerce, you can sell both physical and digital goods in all shapes and sizes, offer product variations, multiple configurations, and instant downloads to shoppers, and even sell affiliate goods from online marketplaces.</p>\n<p>With premium extensions, you can offer bookings, memberships, and recurring subscriptions. Perhaps youâ€™d like to sell monthly subscriptions for physical goods, or offer your members a discount on digital downloads? Itâ€™s all possible.</p>\n<h4>Ship wherever you like</h4>\n<p>Offer free shipping, flat rate shipping, or make real-time calculations. Limit your shipments to specific countries, or open your store up to the world. Shipping is highly configurable, and WooCommerce even supports drop shipping.</p>\n<h4>Extensive payment options</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce comes bundled with the ability to accept major credit cards, PayPal, BACS (bank transfers), and cash on delivery. Need additional options? More than 140 region-specific gateways integrate with WooCommerce, including popular choices like Stripe, Authorize.Net, and Amazon Payments.</p>\n<h4>You control it all &#8212; forever</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce gives you complete control of your store, from taxes to stock levels to customer accounts. Add and remove extensions, change your design, and switch settings as you please. Itâ€™s all under your control.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest risks of using a hosted eCommerce platform is what happens to your store if the provider closes up shop. With WooCommerce, you have complete control, so thereâ€™s never any reason to worry. Your data belongs to you &#8212; and itâ€™s kept secure, thanks to regular audits by industry leaders.</p>\n<h4>Define your style with Storefront</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront</a> is a free WordPress theme available to any WooCommerce store. Along with deep WooCommerce integration, Storefront prioritizes speed and uptime while eliminating theme and plugin conflicts during major updates.</p>\n<p>Define your style even further by customizing Storefront to your liking or choosing from one of our several <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront child themes</a>. Itâ€™s all up to you, and all open source.</p>\n<h4>Built with developers in mind</h4>\n<p>Extendable, adaptable, and open source &#8212; WooCommerce was created with developers in mind. With its strong, robust framework, you can scale your clientâ€™s store all the way from basic to high-end (infinity and beyond).</p>\n<p>Built with a REST API, WooCommerce can integrate with virtually any service. Your storeâ€™s data can be accessed anywhere, anytime, 100% securely. WooCommerce allows developers to easily create, modify, and grow a store that meets their specifications.</p>\n<p>No matter the size of the store you want to build, WooCommerce will scale to meet your requirements. With a growing collection of more than 300 extensions, you can enhance each storeâ€™s features to meet your clientâ€™s unique needs &#8212; or even create your own solution.</p>\n<p>If security is a concern, rest easy. WooCommerce is audited by a dedicated team of developers working around the clock to identify and patch any and all discovered bugs.</p>\n<p>We also support WooCommerce and all its extensions with comprehensive, easily-accessible documentation. With our docs, youâ€™ll learn how to create the exact site your client needs.</p>\n<h4>Extensions galore</h4>\n<p>WordPress.org is home to some amazing extensions for WooCommerce, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration/\">Google Analytics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/\">Delivery Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\">PDF Invoices and Packing Slips</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/affiliates-woocommerce-light/\">Affiliates Integration Light</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-new-product-badge/\">New Product Badges</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keen to see them all?

This will give you the possibility to develop custom priority providers which fit your needs.)</li>\n<li>Added support to use theÂ <a href=\"http://www.alexking.org/blog/2005/07/27/popularity-contest-11/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Popularity Contest</a>Â plugin byÂ <a href=\"http://www.alexking.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alex King</a>Â to calculate post priority (If you are already using the Popularity Contest plugin, this will be the best way to determine the priority of the posts.

This can be made with a cron job for example.)</li>\n<li>Improved compatibility with other plugins (There should no longer be problems with other plugins now which checked for existence of a specified function to determine if you are in the control panel or not.)</li>\n<li>Recoded plugin architecture which is now fully OOP (The code is now cleaner and better to understand which makes it easier to modify. This should also avoid namespace problems.)</li>\n<li>Improved speed and optimized settings handling (Settings and pages are only loaded if the sitemap generation process starts and not every time a page loads. This saves one MySQL Query on every request.)</li>\n<li>Added Button to restore default configuration (Messed up the config? Youâ€™ll need just one click to restore all settings.)</li>\n<li>Added log file to check everything is running (In the new log window you can see when your sitemap was rebuilt or if there was any error.)</li>\n<li>Improved user-interface</li>\n<li>Added several links to homepage and support (This includes the Notify List about new releases and the WordPress support forum.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.7 (2005-11-25)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Polish Translation byÂ <a href=\"http://kubazwolinski.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">kuba</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.7 (2005-11-01)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added French Translation byÂ <a href=\"http://www.chezthierry.info/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thierry Lanfranchi</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.7 (2005-07-21)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug with incorrect date in additional pages (wrong format)</li>\n<li>Added Swedish Translation byÂ <a href=\"http://tobiasbergius.se/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tobias Bergius</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.6 (2005-07-16)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Included Chinese (Simplified) language files byÂ <a href=\"http://www.june6.cn/\" rel=\"nofollow\">june6</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.6 (2005-07-04)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support to store the files at a custom location</li>\n<li>Changed the home URL to have a slash at the end</li>\n<li>Fixed errors with wp-mail</li>\n<li>Added support for other plugins to add content to the sitemap</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.5 (2005-06-15)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can include now external pages which arenâ€™t generated by WordPress or are not recognized by this plugin</li>\n<li>You can define a minimum post priority, which will overrride the calculated value if itâ€™s too low</li>\n<li>The plugin will automatically ping Google whenever the sitemap gets regenerated</li>\n<li>Update 1:Â Included Spanish translations byÂ <a href=\"http://www.cesargomez.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cesar Gomez Martin</a></li>\n<li>Update 2:Â Included Italian translations byÂ <a href=\"http://wordpress-it.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stefano Aglietti</a></li>\n<li>Update 3:Â Included Traditional Chinese translations byÂ <a href=\"http://kirin-lin.idv.tw/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kirin Lin</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2 (2005-06-08)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Language file support: <a href=\"http://hiromasa.zone.ne.jp/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hiromasa</a>Â fromÂ <a href=\"http://hiromasa.zone.ne.jp/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hiromasa.zone.ne.jp</a>Â sent me a japanese version of the user interface and modified the script to support it!

This makes getting the correct client IP to block slightly more complicated.</p>\n<p>The option default to NOT being behind a proxy &#8212; which should be by far the common case.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>How do I know if my site is behind a reverse proxy?</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>You probably are not or you would know. We show a pretty good guess on the option page. Set the option using this unless you are sure you know better.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>Can I whitelist my IP so I don&#8217;t get locked out?</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>First please consider if you really need this. Generally speaking it is not a good idea to have exceptions to your security policies.</p>\n<p>That said, there is now a filter which allows you to do it: &#8220;limit_login_whitelist_ip&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Example:<br />\nfunction my_ip_whitelist($allow, $ip) {<br />\n     return ($ip == &#8216;my-ip&#8217;) ? true : $allow;<br />\n}<br />\nadd_filter(&#8216;limit_login_whitelist_ip&#8217;, &#8216;my_ip_whitelist&#8217;, 10, 2);</p>\n<p>Note that we still do notification and logging as usual. This is meant to allow you to be aware of any suspicious activity from whitelisted IPs.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>I locked myself out testing this thing, what do I do?</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>Either wait, or:</p>\n<p>If you know how to edit / add to PHP files you can use the IP whitelist functionality described above. You should then use the &#8220;Restore Lockouts&#8221; button on the plugin settings page and remove the whitelist function again.</p>\n<p>If you have ftp / ssh access to the site rename the file &#8220;wp-content/plugins/limit-login-attempts/limit-login-attempts.php&#8221; to deactivate the plugin.</p>\n<p>If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can clear the limit_login_lockouts option in the wordpress options table.

Please upgrade immediately.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Auth cookies&#8221; are special cookies set at login that authenticating you to the system. It is how WordPress &#8220;remembers&#8221; that you are logged in between page loads.</p>\n<p>During lockout these are supposed to be cleared, but a change in 1.6.2 broke this. It allowed an attacker to keep trying to break these cookies during a lockout.</p>\n<p>Lockout of normal password login attempts still worked as it should, and it appears that all &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; attempts would keep getting logged.</p>\n<p>In theory the &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; is quite resistant to brute force attack. It contains a cryptographic hash of the user password, and the difficulty to break it is not based on the password strength but instead on the cryptographic operations used and the length of the hash value. In theory it should take many many years to break this hash. As theory and practice does not always agree it is still a good idea to have working lockouts of any such attempts.</p>\n<h4>1.7.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added filter that allows whitelisting IP.

There are still some problems with cookie auth handling. The lockout can trigger prematurely in rare cases, but fixing it is plugin version 2 stuff unfortunately.</li>\n<li>Changed default time for retries to reset from 24 hours to 12 hours.

By default WordPress password protected pages sessions will last 10 days. Orginally came up with this idea when a client didn&#8217;t want password protected pages to stay login. While you could add the code to your funtion.php within your theme but I didn&#8217;t want the code to get overwritten when doing a theme update. Using this plugin avoids the need for updating the funtion.php file.</p>\n<p>Once you have it uploaded to your WordPress install. Simply login to your WordPress backend and activate the plugin. After it&#8217;s activated you no longer need to do anything. You can test the page by refreshing after typing your password or closing your browser and visitin the page again. It will force you to type in the password.</p>\n<p>Tested up to: 4.8.1</p>\n<p>Stable tag: 0.1.0</p>\n<h4>0.1.0</h4>\n<p>*Inital Date &#8211; August 15 2017</p>\n<p>License: GPLv2 or later</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:3:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sortable Lite\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sortable-lite/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 04:04:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sortable-lite/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"Sort by dropdown is the main feature, showing you different options on how to sort&#8230;\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dimitar A.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3662:\"<p><!--section=description--></p>\n<p>Sort by dropdown is the main feature, showing you different options on how to sort your posts or other post types.

Read on for more interesting news from around the WordPress world in July.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Weekly meeting for new core contributors</h2>\n<p>Onboarding new contributors is a persistent issue for most WordPress contribution teams. While every team welcomes any new contributors, the path to getting deeply involved can be tricky to find at times.</p>\n<p>This month, the Core team implemented a fantastic new initiative: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/announcing-a-weekly-new-contributors-meeting/\">weekly meetings for new core contributors</a> as a way to encourage involvement and foster fresh contributions. The meetings not only focus on bugs suited to first-time contributors, they also make space for experienced contributors to help out individuals who may be new to developing WordPress core.</p>\n<p>The meetings are held every Wednesday at 19:00 UTC in the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Increased focus on PHP practices in WordPress core</h2>\n<p>In bringing people together to improve WordPress core, a new channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> named #core-php is designed to focus on PHP development in the project.</p>\n<p>Along with this increased concentration on PHP, a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/06/announcement-for-weekly-php-meetings/\">new weekly meeting is now taking place</a> every Monday at 18:00 UTC in #core-php to improve WordPress coreâ€™s PHP practices.</p>\n<h2>Sharp rise in meetup group growth</h2>\n<p>The dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8 displays local, upcoming WordPress events for the logged in user. The events listed in this widget are pulled from the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">meetup chapter program</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule\">WordCamp schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>This widget provides greater visibility of official WordPress events, and encourages community involvement in these events. Itâ€™s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably â€” since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program. This is compared to 19 new groups and only 7,071 new members in the same time period last year.</p>\n<p>You can find a local meetup group to join <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">on meetup.com</a>, and if you would like to get involved in organizing events for your community, you can find out more about the inner workings of the program <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/\">on the Community Team site</a> or by joining the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8.1 due for imminent release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 cycleâ€™s first maintenance release will be published in the coming week, more than a month after 4.8 was released. This release fix some important issues in WordPress core and the majority of users will find that their sites will update to this new version automatically.</p>\n<p>If you would like to help out by testing this release before it goes live, you can follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/beta/\">beta testing guide</a> for WordPress core.

Read on to hear more about these as well as other interesting stories from around the WordPress world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>WordPress 4.8</h2>\n<p>On June 8, a week before the Community Summit and WordCamp Europe,<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\"> WordPress 4.8 was released</a>.You can read<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/wordpress-4-8-field-guide/\"> the Field Guide</a> for a comprehensive overview of all the features of this release (the News and Events widget in the dashboard is one of the major highlights).</p>\n<p>Most people would either have their version auto-updated, or their hosts would have updated it for them. For the rest, the updates have gone smoothly with no major issues reported so far.</p>\n<p>This WordPress release saw contributions from 346 individuals; you can find their names in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\">the announcement post</a>. To get involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2017</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> was held in Paris between June 15-17. The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/\">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/\">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going â€” to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project â€” have a look through <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/\">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit/\">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; theyâ€™ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/\">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/\">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/\">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community â€” and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/\">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress â€” this project has been dubbed â€œGutenberg.â€� The projectâ€™s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing â€” <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we donâ€™t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, youâ€™ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. Itâ€™s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than weâ€™ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/\">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/\">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href=\"https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/\">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/\">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration â€” thatâ€™s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.

Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure â€” and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and youâ€™re ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id=\"v-8BDWH3QG-1\" class=\"video-player\"><video id=\"v-8BDWH3QG-1-video\" width=\"632\" height=\"342\" poster=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg\" controls=\"true\" preload=\"metadata\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;\" /><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv\" type=\"video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;\" /><div><img alt=\"Link Boundaries\" src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. Youâ€™ll be happier. We promise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">Nearby WordPress Events</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=632%2C465&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=1024%2C753&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=768%2C565&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?w=1126&amp;ssl=1 1126w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress has a thriving offline community with groups meeting regularly in more than 400 cities around the world? WordPress now draws your attention to the events that help you continue improving your WordPress skills, meet friends, and, of course, publish!</p>\n<p>This is quickly becoming one of our favorite features. While you are in the dashboard (because youâ€™re running updates and writing posts, right?) all upcoming WordCamps and official WordPress Meetups â€” local to you â€” will be displayed.</p>\n<p>Being part of the community can help you improve your WordPress skills and network with people you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise meet. Now you can easily find your local events just by logging in to your dashboard and looking at the new Events and News dashboard widget.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">Even More Developer HappinessÂ <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f60a.png\" alt=\"ðŸ˜Š\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/17/cleaner-headings-in-the-admin-screens/\">More Accessible Admin Panel Headings</a></h3>\n<p>New CSS rules mean extraneous content (like â€œAdd Newâ€� links) no longer need to be included in admin-area headings. These panel headings improve the experience for people using assistive technologies.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/\">Removal of Core Support for WMV and WMA Files</a></h3>\n<p>As fewer and fewer browsers support Silverlight, file formats which require the presence of the Silverlight plugin are being removed from core support. Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/\">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/\">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/\">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/\">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href=\"https://matt.blog\">Matt</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17\">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

I was almost forbidden to do things I didn&#8217;t really love. My parents insisted on trying things and finding that deep passion. But I didn&#8217;t have to search and try. I always knew what I&#8217;d be when I grow up. As long as I remember, there was no doubt.</p>\n<h3>A classical musician</h3>\n<p>When I was 8 my mom took me to local music school for entrance examination. I was in! Oh, joy! Finally I was learning to play and sing, to read and write this new language. Italian. Oh, music scores too! There was a whole new world that my parents, or anyone in my family, didn&#8217;t know anything about and I was stepping into it. I was doing just fine in it.. and I couldn&#8217;t live outside of it.</p>\n<p>As time passed, I finished elementary and high music school, went to music Academy, almost finished it and then my mother died. It was 2003. Two weeks later I found out I was pregnant. There was no time for grief and I couldn&#8217;t feel the joy. I just switched off and turned to the facts: I became a mom and a wife and I needed a job.</p>\n<p>And what a job did I found. An opera prompter. Opera Prompter! God, I love that job. Every second of it for ten years. I was yelling at singers, singing, conducting, traveling, laughing and crying. My Italian was significantly improved. Working time was great &#8211; so much free time to be a mom, study for Academy, get a hobby&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Opera prompter&#8217;s hobby</h3>\n<p>In 2007 I was administrator in one English speaking forum with focus on software and hardware topics. It helped me to significantly improve my English. And my tech knowledge. Which was close to none when I registered. As one of administrators, occasionally I had to tweak site here and there. It was great! There was this code and when I would change something in code it would show on the site. Neat! I loved reading those files, finding patterns and parts written in humanly understandable forms. Later I learned those were called loops and conditionals. Also later I learned that this language is called PHP and that many other languages for building websites exist. Forum script was phpBB3.</p>\n<p>I was never a gamer. Never understood the point of game, besides finishing it. I guess PHP was to me what games are to passionate gamers. Like a puzzle or sudoku.</p>\n<p>At the same time my marriage was turning from bad into worse and in the beginning of 2008 I finally decided it was enough. We were working on Mozart&#8217;s â€œDon Giovanniâ€� in Theater. I remember this so clearly because my divorce was just turning from bad into worse. Those few months lasted for centuries after which I still needed a lot of time to recover what&#8217;s left of my self-esteem. My complete mental and emotional health was destroyed after years of domestic violence.</p>\n<p>2009 was important year for me. The cognition of possibility to have local server on my own machine and test everything before executing it on live site turned out to be very helpful.</p>\n<p>In October I needed a blog script and friend recommended WordPress. It was 2.9 version. It didn&#8217;t really work well but everyone was writing about it. There were at least 5 new tutorials on various blogs every day. I was digesting them every morning with my first coffee. The ones I really liked I even reproduced in my shiny new localhost. Soon enough I developed a local monster with different widgets on each page, future posts archive, post series done with custom fields and God knows whatnot. This WordPress was slowly taking over my free time. Every second of it.</p>\n<h3>So, the WordPress it is</h3>\n<p>One day a friend of mine asked me to build him a website for his ensemble. And for money. Money? I never thought of getting money for this. This was too good of a hobby. But he&#8217;s a friend so I did it. Then another friend showed up with the same request. And another.. I became freelance WordPress developer before I could even understand what was happening. It wasn&#8217;t really a favor to friends any more. I was a single mom with mortgage. My daughter was in primary school, life costs became serious while the art-and-culture salary was silently and regularly reduced.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was freelancing every single minute I could. Sleeping was luxury I could afford on weekends.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My dad was helping me tremendously. He was babysitting during theater&#8217;s rehearsals and performances in the evenings. When I&#8217;d get home, my daughter was sleeping, tomorrow&#8217;s meals cooked, dishes done and shining. I could go on like this but it was uncertain for how long.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2013 I was recovering from what was supposed to be routine gallbladder surgery and what nearly cost me life. Almost fully operational, I was getting ready for next roller coaster known as a mix of school year, freelancing and theater&#8217;s season. Then my father died. Suddenly. In an accident.</p>\n<p>Oh, this screaming silence..</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t think. Or breathe. For months. I needed someone to put the roller coaster on pause. Just.. Just a short one. To take a breathe. But there was no one. I was all alone with a 9 years old child who had to grow up fast. I had to grow up fast.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All of a sudden I realized that I can not afford a single mistake any more. I can not be ill, get in debts, lose job. Or mind. I was the only one I could count on.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2014 my theater salary got reduced once again. And again in following year. 30% in total. For ten years it never covered all of my monthly expenses but this was ridiculous. It was a time for me to stop playing it safe and see what I&#8217;m made of. That was probably the most difficult decision I have ever made. A heart breaking one. Stop being musician. So I quit being Opera Prompter and started working as a full time WordPress developer.</p>\n<h3>Well, hello, World!</h3>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t really know for which wage level my knowledge was. For years I was the only WordPress developer I knew in person. The rest were all online superstars I was learning from. So I started as a shy medior and the only WordPress developer in agency. It turns out that, for this agency needs, I was senior and soon enough I was organizing and leading development processes for new projects.</p>\n<p>From the business point of view repeating similar projects makes you &#8220;niche expert&#8221;. I do understand that. But, as many other developers out there, I don&#8217;t like repeating the same tasks or projects. Not even once. I missed variety which led me to become more active contributor on wordpress.org.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For years I was just contributing to codex here and there and never really thought about all the people behind WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In my vague image, they were a bunch of really great developers and they were doing just fine. I was learning from them so I could not possibly help them. I would just be on their way.</p>\n<p>However, in my attempt to find something interesting to keep my mind amused with, I came upon <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Slack url</a> for communication between contributors on WordPress project. What a crowd! And not just developers &#8211; everyone! Doing all kinds of different bits, and all important. How odd. WordPress is not like any other open source community I saw before. So much more open and inviting! I remember reading through channels and thinking: &#8220;I could do this&#8221;, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d love to learn that&#8221;, &#8220;This person is funny&#8221;.. I&#8217;m gonna stick.</p>\n<h3>Antisocial extrovert in a more open open source community</h3>\n<p>No matter how I tried, and I did try, I&#8217;m just not a people person. Among other antisocial treats, over the years I have developed a heavy dark humor which, more often than not, due to lack of social interactions I reveal in a completely wrong way. But these people seem not to mind so I thought to give it a try with them. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/code-of-conduct/\">Code of Conduct</a> is extremely important in WordPress community. No community wants bullies. But rare communities accept social weirdos and misfits. And this one doesn&#8217;t just accept them, it makes them feel like fits. That was a nice change.</p>\n<p>I started attending local <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WP-Meetup-NS/\">Meetups</a>, even gave <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WP-Meetup-NS/events/235186967/\">a talk</a> on contributing to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/\">Theme Review team</a> after which I was invited to join <a href=\"https://www.toptal.com/\">Toptal platform</a> as a freelance developer. My social adventure got me volunteering on <a href=\"https://2017.belgrade.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Belgrade</a> and <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Europe in Paris</a>. I must admit there were &#8220;too many people at the same time&#8221; moments but there were lots of ways to stay involved with controlled dose of human interactions. I chose volunteering at Experts bar and it worked out just great. I really loved all the hugs though.</p>\n<p>Today I try to keep my focus on just a few channels in make WordPress slack and my contribution wish list regularly updated. One can have only so many hours in a day. Most often you&#8217;ll find me in <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2Fdocs\">#docs</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2Fcore-docs\">#core-docs</a> channels, doing various stuff with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/about-the-docs-team/get-involved/\">Documentation</a> team.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/milana-cap_wcbgd.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2036 size-large\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/milana-cap_wcbgd-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Milana, on a rooftop baclony with some other people looking at her phone\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /></a></p>\n<h3>The Questions</h3>\n<p>Among all the questions I get about my professional path, the most commons are &#8220;<strong>How come you made such a huge change from music to web development?</strong>&#8220;, &#8220;<strong>Did you go to school to become a developer</strong>?&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Do you miss being musician?</strong>&#8220;. Answer to the first question is quite easy:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Being musician and writing code are pretty much the same. They both require the same parts of your mental struggle and make you go through the same emotional tortures and enlightenments.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The second question, however, is a bit more difficult to answer. In the light of the first answer, I could say that I was exposed to the required way of thinking. Practicing an instrument 6 hours per day for over a decade does teach you a couple of things about commitment. World of classical music is a world of magnificent talents and varieties which touches you all the way to the humble self where you find appreciation for being able to feel this way. Personally, I believe this is extremely important for developer &#8211; to be humble and grateful to person who helped them find this humbleness.</p>\n<p>No, I don&#8217;t have a formal developer&#8217;s education. It doesn&#8217;t seem to prevent me from being developer. And no, I don&#8217;t miss being musician. Because I never stopped being one. I listen to classical music while I code and play piano when I have a difficult programming problem to solve. Feels so natural.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to say that everything turned out pretty good at the end but, as my father used to say: &#8220;Life is the greatest screenplay writer&#8221; and my life seems to be the witty one too. In expectation of future turns I&#8217;d recommend <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4788Tmz9Zo&t=884s\">Beethoven&#8217;s Symphony No.7, II movement</a>, some very loud laughs and lots of WordPress loops.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: The Greatest Screenplay Writer\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Greatest%20Screenplay%20Writer&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgreatest-screenplay-writer%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: The Greatest Screenplay Writer\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgreatest-screenplay-writer%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgreatest-screenplay-writer%2F&title=The+Greatest+Screenplay+Writer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: The Greatest Screenplay Writer\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/greatest-screenplay-writer/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/081617-150x150.jpg&description=The Greatest Screenplay Writer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: The Greatest Screenplay Writer\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/greatest-screenplay-writer/\" title=\"The Greatest Screenplay Writer\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/greatest-screenplay-writer/\">The Greatest Screenplay Writer</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 12:00:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Milana Cap\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: WordPress Mobile Apps Updated with a New Login Experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74197\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-mobile-apps-updated-with-a-new-login-experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4765:\"<p>The WordPress mobile apps are sporting <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/08/15/an-updated-login-coming-to-the-wordpress-mobile-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">a new login experience</a> that Automattic&#8217;s mobile designers and developers released in the latest versions. The login flow has been completely redesigned to provide a more unified experience for connecting both self-hosted and WordPress.com-hosted sites. These flows were completely separate in the past and users were often confused about which one to select. The new design provides fewer opportunities for friction when logging in, an experience that likely determines many users&#8217; first impressions of the app.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/self-hosted-login-wp-mobile-apps.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Self-hosted login on mobile apps\n<p>&#8220;As we reimagined the login experience, there were a few key principles guiding us: keep it simple, minimize the distinction between a site hosted at WordPress.com versus somewhere else, and avoid anything that might be too clever,&#8221; Automattic mobile lead Eric Johnson said.</p>\n<p>Users can now connect new sites by entering the URL and the mobile apps will automatically detect if the site is hosted on WordPress.com or not. The new login flow ferries users on to the next step based on what kind of site is being connected. This is available in version 8.0 of WordPress for Android and version 8.2 of WordPress for iOS.</p>\n<p>The new login experience emphasizes the ease of using magic links for logging into WordPress.com. If the user enters and email address, the app will generate an authentication link and send it via email. This allows users to login without having to remember or enter a password.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/new-login-experience-wp-mobile-apps.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>If a user is entering the world of WordPress for the first time through the mobile apps, the new login experience also offers a short tour of the some of the features included in the app. These include WordPress.com features such as notifications, Stats, and the Reader. The apps, despite being marketed as the official WordPress mobile apps, are a product of Automattic and include a commercial upgrade path for WordPress.com services.</p>\n<p>The idea of the apps functioning as a gateway to help the greater WordPress ecosystem gain more users (and eventually see some graduate to self-hosted sites), no longer seems credible now that WordPress.com has <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-coms-business-plan-gives-subscribers-a-way-to-tap-into-wordpress-orgs-third-party-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\">entered the hosting space by allowing its customers to tap into third-party plugins and themes</a>.</p>\n<p>The updated login experience, while more convenient for users, continues to blur the line between self-hosted and WordPress.com-hosted sites. WordPress for Android and iOS used to have their own separate blogs but all of the news is now funneled through WordPress.com&#8217;s news blog and the @WordPressiOS and @WPAndroid Twitter accounts seemed to have been abandoned in favor of marketing updates through WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>In the past, many in the WordPress community have asked why the apps are not called the WordPress.com mobile apps, since they include features that are not central to the core publishing experience for self-hosted users. Last year when I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-android-5-7-adds-path-to-upgrade-wordpress-com-plan\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed</a> Maxime Biais, one of Automatticâ€™s mobile engineers, he said the team had considered splitting the product into two apps.</p>\n<p>â€œWe considered having both WordPress and WordPress.com apps, but we rejected this because it doesnâ€™t make it more clear,â€� Bias said. â€œItâ€™s probably even more ambiguous when someone searches the Play Store for &#8216;WordPress&#8217; or &#8216;Blog&#8217; and finds both WordPress and WordPress.com apps.â€�</p>\n<p>Now that that mobile apps have become a direct pipeline for new WordPress.com hosting customers, it may be time to re-visit the consideration of splitting the apps into two distinct products: one for WordPress.com&#8217;s commercial interests and one that officially represents the open source WordPress project for self-hosted users without any corporate interests. If the project&#8217;s official mobile apps are a key part of new users&#8217; onboarding experience, they should accurately represent the software as an independent platform that can be hosted with and extended by any number of free and commercial products in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 06:33:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US to Experiment With A Community Bazaar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74138\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-to-experiment-with-a-community-bazaar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2242:\"<p>In addition to taking place in a new location this year, <a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US</a> will have a <a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/attendee-information/community-bazaar/\">Community Bazaar</a>. An area will be set aside in the venue allowing those chosen to showcase their WordPress communities. Raquel Landefeld, Randy Hicks, and Dustin Mezo are organizing the Bazaar.</p>\n<p>Landefeld says the idea was inspired by the people who make up the WordPress Community. &#8220;We recognize that some local WordPress communities are thriving and some are just getting started,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What better way to help build community then by showcasing our local communities to the world. The thought is that smaller, newer, and communities just in their infancy, will be inspired with fresh ideas and or how-tos from the bigger and more established WordPress communities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The idea is similar to that of a science fair where each community chosen will have a space to highlight why theirs is awesome.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the event is to inspire growth while providing an opportunity for communities to learn from each other. There will also be metrics shared such as, number of meetup and WordCamp attendees, meetups per month, and unique qualities pertaining to the local groups.</p>\n<p>The organizing team is looking for the inside scoop on local communities. &#8220;This is all about you and your local WordPress community,&#8221; Landefeld said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is your time to shine. Why is your community different, special, or amazing? Be showy! Forget modesty. Let your communityâ€™s awesomeness be a tool to inspire other WP communities just getting started or striving.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last year saw record growth for WordPress community events.

Two years after Human Made began searching for a buyer, maekit purchased WP Remote to integrate it with the company&#8217;s existing platform that caters to designers managing multiple clients.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Remote had remained a much-loved product with its users and despite receiving no ongoing development it had remained an iconic plugin in the WordPress community,&#8221; Human Made CEO Tom Willmot said.</p>\n<p>maekit took over WP Remote operations in March after closing the deal. According to maekit CEO Matt Holme, the company inherited 20,000 users with 120,000 WordPress websites. His team has maintained WP Remote in its original platform for the past few months before integrating it into maekit last week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpremote.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Remote</a> has offered unlimited, free WordPress site management (updating core, plugins, and themes with a single click) since 2010. It hasn&#8217;t received ongoing development for several years, but maekit plans to add backup features that will make bring it more up to speed with competitors like MangeWP, MainWP, and InfiniteWP.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We definitely plan to keep WP Remote free and expand its features,&#8221; Holme said. &#8220;Specifically we are looking at offering easy-to-manage cloud-based backup services. For example, hook up your Dropbox (or any other popular cloud based storage system) and schedule regular backups of your WP websites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>maekit&#8217;s acquisition of WP Remote gives the company&#8217;s customers the ability to deploy WordPress sites with one click and manage client sites and domains through a unified, white-labeled invoicing and payment system. The company has rolled out a few long-overdue bug fixes to WP Remote and Holme says the rest of maekit is functional but still technically in a closed beta mode.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our revenue model revolves around direct sale hosting plans and also reselling integrated hosting plans for other leading global hosting providers,&#8221; Holme said. &#8220;We are refining the free invoicing and payment processing system built into maekit so that a maekit / WP Remote user can deploy a new hosted WP and charge their client a recurring monthly fee and retain the mark up they add on top of our base hosting prices as profit. This means literally no out of pocket expense for maekit / WP Remote users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although maekit&#8217;s one-click deployment service supports many popular CMS&#8217;s and e-commmerce platforms, including WordPress, Opencart, Drupal, Magento, and Joomla, Holme said the vast majority of the company&#8217;s customers are running on WordPress. Acquiring WP Remote brings a host of valuable new features to maekit&#8217;s customer base. maekit&#8217;s built-in client billing features, customized for freelancers and agencies, are what Holme says will differentiate the company from its competitors in the WordPress space.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have a great deal of respect for these other WP management platforms and feel the size of the WP market means there is opportunity for all to succeed,&#8221; Holme said. &#8220;With the features of maekit also including new website deployment, invoicing, payment processing and client management, our platform is unique from the others.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 03:50:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.8.0 Introduces 5 New Blocks: Categories, Text Columns, Shortcode, Audio, and Video\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-8-0-introduces-5-new-blocks-categories-text-columns-shortcode-audio-and-video\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5712:\"<p>Gutenberg <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/whats-new-in-gutenberg-11th-august/\" target=\"_blank\">0.8.0</a> was released over the weekend with five new blocks, major improvements to existing blocks, and support for more publishing features that have been missing from the new editor&#8217;s sidebar. The release also carries out the controversial decision to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/user-tracking-to-be-removed-from-gutenberg-in-upcoming-0-8-0-release\" target=\"_blank\">remove the opt-in usage tracking code from the plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2102\" target=\"_blank\">Categories block</a> can be found under the Widgets section, as it&#8217;s output is based on the existing categories widget.

The settings include a sliding scale for selecting 2-4 columns.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/text-columns-block-e1502741151590.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Contributors are calling the Text Block &#8220;an initial exploration&#8221; of multiple columns for text-only content. Depending on testing, it may not be the implementation that ends up landing in the plugin permanently.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been over how difficult it is to get columns right, and also how already today third parties can build this,&#8221; Joen Asmussen <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2117#issuecomment-319347010\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;We may very well want an entirely different implementation than this one. But perhaps it&#8217;s good to get this in now and test it. Perhaps this can help inform how a better column implementation can work down the road. In fact we might want to merge this block in now, only to take it back out later again, same as the Cover Text block. For that reason, I think it&#8217;d be good to test this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The new Video and Audio blocks are geared towards inserting files that have already been uploaded to the media library. However, I found the text on the video block to be confusing. If I was new to WordPress and didn&#8217;t understand how oEmbed works, I would be clicking inside the video block to figure out where to paste the URL.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/video-block.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The new Audio and Video blocks mirror the same kind of functionality that users have experienced when adding images to their sites. In the future, contributors may introduce more features to the audio block, such as additional playback types and looping, but the first iteration includes just the basics.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 0.8.0 adds resizing handlers to the existing Image Block, making it easy for users to insert and quickly resize an image. If you review the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2213\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub ticket</a> for this feature, it&#8217;s clear that it was not easy to implement. Image resizing has gone through several changes and may have more down the road, especially as it pertains to the behavior of the caption. Ultimately, the caption field should not be wider than the image so that the two are placed together.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/image-resizing-gutenberg.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release introduces a post formats selector to the post settings sidebar. It includes a suggestion based on what blocks are in use in the post. One participant on the ticket noted that the suggestion gives too much importance to the post formats selection and might be confusing to users. The suggestion persists, despite a user switching the format to the one suggested. This is because Gutenberg cannot detect if it was explicitly set by the user or if the user selected the suggestion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I happen to agree with you: post formats should go away,&#8221; Joen Asmussen <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2307#issuecomment-321232074\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;In fact part of the genesis of blocks as a concept is to provide a better interface than what post formats did. So the post format selector here is strictly a back-compat thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/post-format-selector.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg contributors have also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2288\" target=\"_blank\">updated</a> the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/master/docs/design.md\" target=\"_blank\">design document</a> for the project, offering more clarity on their goals and concepts they are using to build the editor:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ultimately, the vision for Gutenberg is to make it much easier to author rich content. Through ensuring good defaults, wrapping and bundling advanced layout options blocks, and making the most important actions immediately available, authoring content with WordPress should be accessible to anyone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The idea is to simplify content creation for users so that they only have to learn one interface &#8211; the block interface. The design document adds several new sections that elaborate on the concept of &#8220;everything is a block&#8221; and includes best practices that developers can reference when designing their own blocks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 22:18:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"WPTavern: Early Results from NRKbetaâ€™s Comment Quiz Plugin Show Readers Enjoy the Quiz but Rarely Leave a Comment\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74105\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:123:\"https://wptavern.com/early-results-from-nrkbetas-comment-quiz-plugin-show-readers-enjoy-the-quiz-but-rarely-leave-a-comment\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3514:\"<p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://nrkbeta.no/\" target=\"_blank\">NRKbeta</a>, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporationâ€™s media and technology site, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/nrkbeta-open-sources-comment-quiz-plugin-for-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">open sourced its comment quiz plugin for WordPress</a>. The site&#8217;s publishers have been experimenting with requiring their readers to complete a short, three-question quiz before giving access to the comment form on certain articles. The goal of the plugin was to prevent rants and off-topic responses by ensuring that commenters have read the article.</p>\n<p>NRKbeta has <a href=\"https://nrkbeta.no/2017/08/10/with-a-quiz-to-comment-readers-test-their-article-comprehension/\" target=\"_blank\">published some preliminary results</a> after six months of experimenting with a mandatory quiz before commenting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On average, there are a lot more attempts â€“ both correct and wrong â€“ than actual comments,&#8221; NRKbeta journalist StÃ¥le Grut said. &#8220;It seems many take the quiz to check how much they remember from the story â€“ and not necessarily to leave a comment. Almost as a fun little game after reading.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nkrbeta-comments.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Grut reported that on average the quiz has an error rate of 72%. His team suspects that the bulk of the wrong answers are coming site&#8217;s international readership, as most of the articles are posted in Norwegian, which can be difficult to translate.</p>\n<p>The sample is still relatively small, because the team hasn&#8217;t yet created any set rules for when authors should enable the quiz.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea was to test it on stories that had potential for a gloomy comments section,&#8221; Grut said. &#8220;It is something we are proud to rarely have here at NRKbeta.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On one story, NRKbeta staff made an error where it was impossible to submit the correct answer to the quiz, because it wasn&#8217;t listed. As a result, this article&#8217;s quiz received more than 1,000 wrong answers.</p>\n<p>One unexpected benefit of the plugin is that it makes it more of a hurdle for readers to leave short comments, such as &#8220;nice post&#8221; that don&#8217;t add much to the conversation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This favors the most eager with the most time on their hands,&#8221; Grut said. &#8220;From time to time this has led to a decline in quality and tone, causing him to often abandon the quiz module.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These initial conclusions are in line with what we predicted when the plugin was released: the most motivated ranters are not significantly inconvenienced by a short quiz. Keeping comment sections free of trolls is not yet something that is easy to automate. It still requires time spent in the moderation queue.</p>\n<p>After the comment quiz plugin was enabled on the site, NRKbeta counted more than 300 articles around the web that had been published about the experiment.

Most law professors were, and still are, publishing blogs on <a href=\"http://www.typepad.com/\">TypePad</a>, an outdated and little used publishing software, originally produced by Six Apart.</p>\n<p>Today, WordPress is running almost 70 percent of the content management systems in the world. WordPress is regularly updated and enables a multi-user platform with multiple individual sites, all of which would be needed by a law schoolâ€™s &#8216;printing press&#8217;.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Glutenberg Free</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/glutenburg-free/\">Gluternberg Free</a> is a WordPress plugin developed by Adam Silverstein that restores and maintains the post editing experience from WordPress 4.8.</p>\n<h2>Open Source Candy Bar Labels for WordCamps</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re organizing a WordCamp and want to give out Happiness bars, check out this <a href=\"https://github.com/dimensionmedia/WordCamp-Happiness-Bars\">custom label design</a> used at WordCamp Miami 2016.

Blog posts are easier to archive and link to, are not lost in the noise as quickly, and are a better user experience for consuming content.</p>\n<p>By the way, if you&#8217;ve already threaded a message on Twitter, Rush shares links to tools that can help capture a thread and turn it into a blog post.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.customerservant.com/next-time-youre-thinking-threading-twitter-write-blog-post-instead/\">The Next Time You&#8217;re Thinking About Threading On Twitter, Write A Blog Post Instead</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Story of HelloSales</h2>\n<p>iThemes published a <a href=\"https://ithemes.com/2017/08/10/story-of-our-newest-ithemes-product-hellosales/\">detailed article</a> on how their newest product, <a href=\"https://ithemes.com/hellosales\">HelloSales</a>, came to be. Cory Miller explains the product&#8217;s logo, name, and who the people are that are building it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The rooster is essentially the symbol or emblem of Portugal. Youâ€™ll see it everywhere there when you go there (and I strongly encourage you to do so, even if I want to keep the place all to myself).</p>\n<p>It became obvious we wanted to include a rooster in the logo of HelloSales as a hat tip to Portugal and our team there. We also think itâ€™s a great symbol for what we hope to help our customers do â€” make more money through their WooCommerce stores.</p>\n<p>Through several iterations of a name, we landed on HelloSales as a name, as yet another hat tip to the story â€” their companyâ€™s name, HelloDev â€” that led us here.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s a cool story and one I&#8217;d like to see more CEO and founders share when they acquire a product or business.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Telemetry Part Two</h2>\n<p>Morten Rand-Hendriksen <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-telemetry-wordpress-morten-rand-hendriksen\">updated his article</a> on the case for WordPress telemetry after a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/895299336375902209\">lengthy conversation</a> on Twitter.</p>\n<blockquote><p>What WordPress needs is an open debate on this topic. What are the arguments for and against? What can be gained and what is lost? Should we do this? And if so, how do we do it in an open, transparent, and responsible way that helps inform and elevate the conversation while looking after the interests of <em>all</em> WordPress users?</p></blockquote>\n<p>These are interesting questions and although the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38418\">ticket</a><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38418\"> is closed</a> on Trac, users are encouraged to continue the discussion.

The development cycle kicked off in early August with Beta 1 scheduled for early October and the official release targeted for November 14.</p>\n<p>Choyce published a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/\" target=\"_blank\">list of goals</a> today that outlines what they will be aiming for in 4.9. WordPress users can expect to see some existing features polished up to be more user-friendly, including some long-awaited updates to the experience of editing theme and plugin files in the admin.</p>\n<p>Contributors are looking at <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6531\" target=\"_blank\">adding a nested folder structure</a> that will offer access to files deeper than two levels. They are also aiming to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31779\" target=\"_blank\">add better warnings</a> for users who are editing themes and plugins, an improvement which Choyce described as &#8220;graduating from cowboy coding school.&#8221; This could help prevent users from unknowingly making small errors that could have a negative impact on their sites.</p>\n<p>Another goal for 4.9 is to improve the code editing experience by adding syntax highlighting. Contributors are examining the possibility of incorporating CodeMirror functionality into the Customizer&#8217;s custom CSS box as well as the plugin and theme file editors. An experimental <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/codemirror-wp\" target=\"_blank\">Syntax Highlighting Code Editor for WordPress Core</a> plugin is currently being developed on GitHub as a potential solution for a seven-year-old trac <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> for code editor improvements.</p>\n<p>Customizer improvements are also one of the main focuses for 4.9. Contributors to the Customize Snapshots feature plugin have been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/customize-snapshots-0-6-0-adds-the-ability-to-name-and-merge-changesets\" target=\"_blank\">steadily refining</a> the ability to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896\" target=\"_blank\">draft</a> and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28721\" target=\"_blank\">schedule</a> changesets in the Customizer. They are also looking at providing a better experience for <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39693\" target=\"_blank\">widget</a> and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39692\" target=\"_blank\">menu mapping</a> when switching between themes, improving homepage settings (&#8220;<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16379\" target=\"_blank\">Page on Front</a>&#8220;), and displaying responsive images in the Customizer sidebar.</p>\n<p>This list of goals for 4.9 includes many more items and the release leads are approaching it with the understanding that some features and improvements may not be ready in time. One item on the list is getting in <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Core+REST+API+Task%22\" target=\"_blank\">API endpoints that Gutenberg requires</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to WordPress 5.0, new Gutenberg design lead Tammie Lister has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/\" target=\"_blank\">proposed a revised, tentative roadmap</a> that anticipates having the new editor ready for a merge proposal in December 2017. Lister said the outline is not set in stone and Gutenberg&#8217;s path to 5.0 would be dependent on the success of the merge proposal.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 19:19:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:127:\"WPTavern: WordPress.comâ€™s Business Plan Gives Subscribers a Way to Tap into WordPress.orgâ€™s Third-party Ecosystem\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74048\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:122:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-coms-business-plan-gives-subscribers-a-way-to-tap-into-wordpress-orgs-third-party-ecosystem\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8448:\"<p>Earlier this year, WordPress.com <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-experiments-with-allowing-business-plan-customers-to-install-third-party-plugins-and-themes\">launched an experiment</a> giving <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/business/\">Business plan subscribers</a> the ability to install third-party plugins and themes. Automattic<a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/08/07/wordpress-com-business-now-supports-plugins-and-third-party-themes/\"> concluded the experiment</a> earlier this week and officially made the features part of the subscription plan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With support for plugins and third-party themes, WordPress.com Business users will be able to connect their sites to great email and social media tools, e-commerce solutions, publishing and subscription services, and more,&#8221; Mark Armstrong said.</p>\n<p>This change is twelve years in the making. With the exception of WordPress VIP, customers have not had the ability to install third-party themes and plugins on WordPress.com.</p>\n<h2>Customers Can Only Install Custom Plugins Through The WP-Admin Interface</h2>\n<p>Customers can install plugins or themes from the WordPress.org directories or they can upload custom themes and plugins. WordPress.com has two user interfaces, one that resembles Calypso and the other is WP-Admin.</p>\n<p>Here is what adding plugins looks like using the Calypso interface. Plugins are displayed from the WordPress.org plugin directory with no way to upload a custom plugin.</p>\n<img />Adding Plugins on WordPress.com Through The Calypso Interface\n<p>This is what adding plugins looks like using the WP-Admin interface. This interface has a button that allows customers to upload a custom plugin. Automattic is aware of the discrepancy and says they&#8217;re working on streamlining both interfaces.</p>\n<img />Adding Plugins Through WP-Admin on WordPress.com\n<h2>Customers Can Upload Non 100% GPL Licensed Code to WordPress.com</h2>\n<p>The ability to upload a custom theme or plugin truly opens the door for subscribers to customize their sites. But it also allows customers to use themes and plugins that are not 100% GPL licensed. Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Automattic, has <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/themes-are-gpl-too/\">made it clear</a> in the past that he will only support plugins and themes that are 100% GPL.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even though graphics and CSS arenâ€™t <em>required</em> to be GPL legally, the lack thereof is pretty limiting. Can you imagine WordPress without any CSS or JavaScript? So as before, we will only promote and host things on WordPress.org that are 100% GPL <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility\">or compatible</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg has used his <a href=\"http://designcrumbs.com/automatically-blackballed\">influence in the past</a> to provoke marketplaces such as Envato to provide a 100% GPL license option to its authors. Authors who choose not to sell their items with the 100% GPL license are excluded from being able to sponsor or speak at WordCamps.</p>\n<p>Although the above quote references WordPress.org, WordPress.com is a platform that Mullenweg controls. It&#8217;s odd that the ability to upload a theme or plugin that is not 100% GPL exists on WordPress.com. I believe the feature is an oversight and will be removed in the immediate future ensuring that only themes and plugins from the official directories are allowed to be used.</p>\n<h2>Managed WordPress Hosts Have Reasons to Be Concerned</h2>\n<p>Responses to the news from members of the WordPress community are mixed. Phil Crumm, Director of Strategic Opportunities at 10up, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@philcrumm/the-curious-conundrum-of-the-new-wordpress-com-business-plan-b0044ad57acd\">published a great article</a> that examines the potential impacts this move will have on the managed WordPress hosting ecosystem and its community:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"8b34\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Within the WordPress community, thereâ€™s long been a notion that &#8216;more users on WordPress&#8217; is universally good. Until now, thatâ€™s been difficult to argue: an expansive ecosystem has developed over the last decade, and many now make their living off of WordPress.</p>\n<p id=\"2813\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Despite that, WordPress.comâ€™s Business Plan now feels like itâ€™s oriented towards cannibalizing users from elsewhere within that ecosystemâ€Šâ€”â€Šfrom sites that may have &#8216;grown up&#8217; and moved to another hosting provider to those that now may not know that the broader ecosystem even existsâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhich is objectively a step backwards for the WordPress community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://perezbox.com/\">Tony Perez</a>, co-founder and CEO of Sucuri, says the <a href=\"https://perezbox.com/2017/08/automattics-push-managed-wordpress-potential-impacts-hosting-ecosystem/\">implications are gravest</a> to managed WordPress hosts. &#8220;The biggest impacts however are likely to be towards those hosting companies that have invested resources (both people and dollars) into creating a vibrant Managed WordPress hosting business ecosystem,&#8221; Perez said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Long are the days when the market was defined by Page.ly and WPEngine. Today I would consider the space to be saturated, with more flavors of Managed WordPress than ice cream at a Baskin-Robbins.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://chrislema.com/\">Chris Lema</a>, a member of Liquid Web&#8217;s Leadership team, <a href=\"https://perezbox.com/2017/08/automattics-push-managed-wordpress-potential-impacts-hosting-ecosystem/#comment-3456606874\">responded to the article</a> saying it&#8217;s rare for manufactures to enter the same market as their distributors or partners.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While not impossible, we rarely see manufacturers get into the same business as their distributors or retail partners,&#8221; Lema said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because it can create a lot of unwanted, unplanned for, unintended secondary consequences. But to inexpensive hosts, this is one of those head-turners, because they were assured, for oh so long, that this wasn&#8217;t the game Automattic was getting into.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But Automattic is not just a nice community player. They&#8217;re a business. With investors. And they have to think about their own bottom line. So while it&#8217;s not surprising, I think you&#8217;re right that hosts have the most to be thinking about.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Others like Scott Bolinger, have expressed cautious optimism regarding the change.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">3rd party plugins and themes can now be used on <a href=\"https://t.co/eNa4NCrrPO\">https://t.co/eNa4NCrrPO</a>. This is great news, although how great remains to be seen. <a href=\"https://t.co/TntfJJ9sLD\">https://t.co/TntfJJ9sLD</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Scott Bolinger (@scottbolinger) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottbolinger/status/894627296648114176\">August 7, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some theme and plugin authors see it as a growth opportunity. Josh Pollock, founder of <a href=\"https://calderaforms.com/\">CalderaWP,</a>Â is excited to see WordPress.com become a quality hosting option for his users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a plugin author, I like not just more places for my plug-in to be used, but more quality hosting options,&#8221; Pollock said. &#8220;Dealing with sub-optimal environments is the hardest part of being a plug-in author. I&#8217;m excited about more users and having those users be on a quality platform.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>How Much Pie Does Automattic Want?</h2>\n<p>WordPress.com offering a subset of customers the ability to access the incredible third-party WordPress plugin and theme ecosystem is a huge development, but it leaves me with a few questions.

The data collection included in last week&#8217;s release reignited the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38418\" target=\"_blank\">discussion regarding adding telemetry to WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>James Nylen and an Automattic engineers involved in Gutenberg added the feature with the goal of improving the editor based on usage patterns. Nylen said the approach they used was very similar to Calypso&#8217;s event tracking code and that it would provide &#8220;a very useful technique to collect user experience data.&#8221; They had planned to use the data to inform various decisions, such as default order for blocks and whether some blocks are less suitable for core. Gutenberg contributors were looking into making the tracking its own module so it could be useful for other WP feature plugins and core.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the feature was added to Gutenberg, contributors began to revisit the Telemetry discussion on WordPress Trac. The topic of telemetry for core had been tabled earlier this year, as it did not fall within the three core focus areas for WordPress development in 2017. Participants requested the ticket be reopened for discussion looking toward 2018 in light of Gutenberg adding opt-in tracking.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a terrible idea for Gutenberg, too,&#8221; Matt Mullenweg commented on the ticket. &#8220;I doubt that anything actionable or useful will come of it that couldn&#8217;t be obtained by non-data-collecting means.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Twelve hours later, James Nylen <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/06/opt-in-usage-tracking-in-gutenberg/#comment-32882\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on his original announcement to notify the community that tracking will be removed from Gutenberg in the 0.8.0 release:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Thereâ€™s been quite a lot of discussion on this topic across the community, much of which stems from earlier discussions like <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38418\" target=\"_blank\">#38418</a>, which I wasnâ€™t aware of.</p>\n<p>Usage tracking in Core and feature projects is a much bigger topic than fits into the scope of Gutenberg right now, so Iâ€™ve removed it from the GitHub repo, and it will be removed in the 0.8 Gutenberg release.</p>\n<p>The data that it was tracking, while interesting, probably wouldnâ€™t have been a significant factor in the long-term growth and development of Gutenberg. The discussion surrounding the data collection, however, would take up a disproportionate amount of the teamâ€™s time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nylen said the data collected by the plugin thus far will be deleted after 0.8 rolls out and that since it&#8217;s so early in Gutenberg&#8217;s development there was &#8220;not enough data collected to provide any sort of picture of usage.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress Telemetry Advocates Continue Lobbying for Opt-In Data Collection</h3>\n<p>The discussion about whether or not WordPress needs telemetry has continued in the form of tweetstorms, as data collection advocates make the case for data-driven decision making.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The decision not to capture metrics (telemetry) from WordPress is one that continues to have a large impact on what we (don&#8217;t) know,&#8221; Liquid Web VP of Product Chris Lema <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrislema/status/895136427977068544\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;As we&#8217;re trying to make decisions about Gutenberg and metaboxes, we might ask, how big a problem is this, by number of plugins or sites. But we don&#8217;t know because we decided that we can always iterate WordPress, like we&#8217;ve always done. It&#8217;s true that we&#8217;ve done that before, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s either the wisest approach, nor the least risky. With so many options today, will people necessarily return? The more logical approach, in my mind, is to capture as much data as possible and to make it as public as possible, so we can all review.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If the problem were lack of data, we could easily produce terabytes per day.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/895506034533453825\">August 10, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">seconded with the power of 1000 suns</p>\n<p>&mdash; joe guilmette <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f1f9-1f1ed.png\" alt=\"ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@travlbum) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/travlbum/status/895539950933782528\">August 10, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mor10.com/the-case-for-wordpress-telemetry/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Telemetry proposal</a> author Morten Rand-Hendriksen joined in the discussion with another <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/895299336375902209\" target=\"_blank\">tweetstorm</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress needs a core method for collecting quantitative user data through telemetry (metrics). One of the biggest challenges WordPress faces is the lack of reliable data about global day-to-day use. Like most Open Source projects, WordPress has relied on community feedback as its primary data source, which is fine for a small project. The problem is WordPress is a Very Big Project with global reach and the majority of its users never interface with the community. </p>\n<p>I like to say we, the people who talk about, provide feedback for, and design/develop WordPress are the 1%. It might be more like 0.1%. Making decisions based on the traditional community feedback model is making decisions without knowing anything about the majority of users. Some will argue this is fine, that WordPress is developed by those who show up. That&#8217;s not a workable or responsible model for a project. We, the people who build WordPress, have a duty of care to the people we build it for. And those people are not us. &#8216;We can just do user testing,&#8217; you say? Sure. Let&#8217;s do proper qualitative user testing. That requires staffing, funding, and infrastructure. User testing for a project like WordPress is non-trivial. It requires professional analysis.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Rand-Hendriksen&#8217;s tweetstorm continued with a summary of his telemetry proposal which would be opt-in based on a plugin prompted from core. The plugin would anonymize all collected data and allow for targeted data collection based on research needs. He proposes that the data be stored on servers owned by the community, separate from corporate interests, so the data can be shared openly to ensure transparency. The <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38418\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> for this feature request is currently closed.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This discussion belongs in Trac in an open ticket. Closing it down because one person disagrees is not the Open Source way.</p>\n<p>&mdash; MortenRandHendriksen (@mor10) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/895307240122368001\">August 9, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;Thereâ€™s a ton going on, and itâ€™s far more important than built-in big brother centralized tracking,&#8221; Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/895678580935491588\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in response to Rand-Hendriksen&#8217;s tweetstorm. &#8220;Do it as a plugin or with a host and show it informs a decision that we wouldnâ€™t have taken otherwise. And remember that past usage is not a good predictor of future success, or what the world needs. We need to build iPhones not Blackberries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle\" target=\"_blank\">2016 State of the Word</a> address, Mullenweg proposed a new structure for core releases in 2017 where he would be putting on the &#8216;product lead&#8217; hat and have design and user testing lead the way. As feature requests have popped up outside of the three core focus areas, Mullenweg has had to systematically shut them down or put them on hold for later in order to keep Gutenberg on track.</p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s not surprising that the engineers leading the Gutenberg project, most of whom are employed by Automattic, wouldn&#8217;t think twice about adding user tracking. The company has <a href=\"https://data.blog/\" target=\"_blank\">a blog entirely devoted to data</a> where its data scientists write about the data pipelines they have built to help the company create a sustainable business. Historically, Automattic has strongly embraced using data in making decisions, which is why Calypso has event tracking built into it. Mullenweg is taking a different product leadership approach with the open source WordPress project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For people unhappy with our direction, no amount of data will change their minds,&#8221; Mullenweg said in response to critics on Twitter. &#8220;The results will tell. Iâ€™m happy to stand by them the past 14 years, and believe the next 14 will validate our approach.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 02:08:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Forks select2, Releases selectWoo as a Drop-In Replacement with Improved Accessibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73999\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-forks-select2-releases-selectwoo-as-a-drop-in-replacement-with-improved-accessibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4165:\"<p>The WooCommerce development team has <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/08/08/selectwoo-an-accessible-replacement-for-select2/\" target=\"_blank\">forked select2</a> to create a more accessible, drop-in replacement library called selectWoo. <a href=\"https://select2.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">select2</a> is a widely used jQuery-based library for making custom drop down menus. Many users are wondering if the project has been abandoned, because the repository hasn&#8217;t seen any activity since February and 115 pull requests have piled up.</p>\n<p>In the interest of fixing some long-standing accessibility issues with the library, WooCommerce opted to fork it and has merged in some of the PRs that were submitted to the original project. SelectWoo is backwards-compatible and can be used the same way as select2 by simply replacing the select2.js file. It has been optimized for WordPress plugin development and can optionally be initialized with .selectWoo() in order to run alongside other versions of select2 that may be used by other plugins on the site.</p>\n<p>SelectWoo makes many improvements for those who are using screen readers, but it needs more accessibility testing. <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/selectWoo/releases/tag/woo-1.0.0-beta.1\" target=\"_blank\">Beta 1</a> is availabe on GitHub. The WooCommerce team has even created a <a href=\"https://woocommerce.github.io/selectWoo/accessibility-testing/\" target=\"_blank\">testing page</a> with different example pages so those using screen-reading software can easily test for bugs.</p>\n<p>Forking is usually a last resort scenario for extending popular open source libraries, but the WooCommerce team wanted the flexibility of improving the project on their own timeline. One concerned developer asked the team what will happen in the future if select2 gets back on track and why they didn&#8217;t just submit pull requests to the select2 repository.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With a fork we can at least get things merged in to meet our own schedule, rather than waiting/relying on others or running custom versions,&#8221; WooCommerce lead developer Mike Jolley said. &#8220;There are other benefits, too, such as allowing our version to be namespaced to avoid conflicts in WP admin. The fork is public. Our changes can be merged back, when/if the project picks up again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Both WordPress and Drupal core contributors have been working to <a href=\"https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/3744\" target=\"_blank\">address accessibility issues in select2</a> since 2015 when the WP Accessibility Team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2015/09/07/accessibility-usertest-select2/\" target=\"_blank\">performed extensive testing on the library</a> to see if it was fit for use in core. Some initial planning work happened but work on these issues stalled out as select2&#8217;s maintainers became unavailable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d do it with PRs if I thought they would get merged in, but I doubt they will,&#8221; WooCommerce developer Claudiu Lodromanean <a href=\"https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/3744#issuecomment-320464534\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;There&#8217;s been no action in this repo in about six months and the fork contains some PRs that have been waiting to get merged here for a very long time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Forking a project can needlessly fragment its contributors by causing them to have to choose one or the other, especially as the projects diverge down the line. Motivated contributors may submit multiple PRs across both projects for improvements but most will simply contribute back to the project they use. Select2&#8217;s maintainers have not published any news about why the project has gone dormant.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are <a href=\"https://github.com/select2/select2/pulls\" target=\"_blank\">over 100 PRs in the select2 repo</a> unmerged,&#8221; Jolley said in response to commenters asking about the necessity of the fork. &#8220;Some of these we actually need, so with the fork weâ€™re free to merge these as needed. The accessibility issues are hurting users today, so we cannot really afford to wait.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 03:54:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 284 â€“ Catching Up with David Peralty\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=74024&preview=true&preview_id=74024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-284-catching-up-with-david-peralty\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2872:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"https://jjj.blog/\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://peralty.com/\">David Peralty</a>.

The program targets communities in Latin and South America, Africa, Oceania, and Asia.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Specifically, we want to shine more light on the potential of open source software in countries where there is less participation in OSS projects,&#8221; WordPress Community Team leader Andrea Middleton said. &#8220;To help spread the word about the potential that open source has to offer, weâ€™d like to provide financial support for two educational events this year, to be organized in parts of the world with less participation in open source.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After the success of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-incubator-program-to-launch-in-indonesia-zimbabwe-and-columbia\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Incubator Program</a>, which brought three new camps to Indonesia, Zimbabwe, and Colombia, there is some evidence that initiatives to bring WordPress to other parts of the world can have valuable returns. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/harare-zimbabwe-to-host-its-2nd-wordcamp-november-4-2017\" target=\"_blank\">Harare is hosting its second WordCamp</a> in November and the local meetup group has nearly doubled over the past year. The other camps had similarly successful events and growth in meetup numbers.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Harare organizer Thabo Tswana said that one of the biggest impacts that the first WordCamp had was to introduce local attendees to the WordPress community. WordPress software is well-known across the world but many do not know that there is a strong community behind the project that they can connect with.</p>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation is looking for organizers to host &#8220;Introduction to Open Source&#8221; events that will be structured as two-hour workshops using <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/user-lessons/what-is-open-source/\" target=\"_blank\">training</a> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/user-lessons/what-can-you-do-with-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">materials</a> available in the WordPress handbook. The goal is to introduce attendees to the world of open source software, the GPL license, and how it is important for WordPress as an open source project.</p>\n<p>The Foundation is subsidizing the events (up to $500) so they will be free for anyone to attend. A <a href=\"http://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/open-source-training-organizer-application\" target=\"_blank\">10-question application</a> is open for those who want to organize an event in 2017. The call for organizers says that preference will be given to organizers who are already members of a group that is part of WordPress&#8217; meetup chapter program and areas where no WordCamp has previously been organized. Applications close August 21 and successful applicants will be notified by September 8.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Aug 2017 19:19:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"Post Status: Publish Conference, in pictures\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=38424\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://poststatus.com/publish-conference-pictures/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34326:\"<p>Pictures from <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/publish\">Post Status Publish</a> were almost all taken by <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/people/brian-richards/\">Brian Richards</a>, unless they are pictures of Brian Richards.

Quote: Thanks to the WordPress meetup, I found focus, fun, friends, and what passes for fame.\" /><p>I did not spend my childhood wanting to grow up to be a WordPress consultant. Given that I was born in 1967, long before the World Wide Web even existed, I would have had to be clairvoyant to aspire to any kind of web development. I was intrigued by computers when I first encountered the TRS-80 at the age of 12, but other than learning a few lines of BASIC, I didnâ€™t pursue programming.</p>\n<p>Parenthetically, I donâ€™t think it was because girls werenâ€™t encouraged to become programmers. This was even before the days of the Control Data Institute commercials on TV. Programming as a career for anyone at all was not in the minds of the general public, at least not in Ohio. And although I thought computers were cool (being a science fiction fan and all), I didnâ€™t have any clear sense of what you could do with them. I never made the mental connection between writing a 10-line program in BASIC and eventually creating something like a video game or a word-processing program.</p>\n<p>During my freshman year in college, I fell into the Classics Vortex, and ended up going to graduate school to study Greek and Latin drama. I expected to get my degree and a university teaching job.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I spoke at a few conferences and published a few papers. And I discovered the World Wide Web.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Iâ€™d gotten online in 1985, also in my freshman year at Brown. We were on BITNET and someone in the computer center showed me how to get onto Relay when I was down their using the mainframe to write essays with. (Fly, sledgehammer, boom.) The Internet came into being about the time I got to graduate school in 1989, and someone showed me the Web in 1994. It blew me away, because a visual medium of communication is vastly superior to a text-based medium when youâ€™re talking about theatrical productions.</p>\n<p>By the end of 1994 Iâ€™d moved to England and created my first web page. (We didnâ€™t have websites in those days, just â€˜pages.â€™ Even if there were lots of pages. And wow, I just wrote that in inverted commas rather than quotation marks, as if my brain shifted itself back to Britain just thinking about it.)</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DIDASKALIA-1998-min.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2017\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DIDASKALIA-1998-min-1024x506.png\" alt=\"Sallieâ€™s first website, Didaskalia, as it was in 1998\" width=\"960\" height=\"474\" /></a>Sallieâ€™s first website, Didaskalia, as it was in 1998\n<p>So youâ€™d think that maybe, from there, I would have gotten into a career in web development whether or not WordPress had ever existed, but that wasnâ€™t what actually happened.</p>\n<h3>When Your Body Isn&#8217;t Your Friend</h3>\n<p>While I was still in graduate school, I developed a debilitating chronic illness that prevented me from finishing my PhD due to a combination of physical and cognitive problems, and although I started to get better at first, by the end of 1998, when I had to return to the US, my condition had worsened to the point where I wasnâ€™t sure Iâ€™d ever be able to work. I spent about 18 months just going to doctors and therapists and support groups. When I did start working, it was as a caregiver, doing extremely simple tasks, because my confidence in my ability to do knowledge work of any kind was so badly damaged.</p>\n<p>I eventually started doing more kinds of things to earn money: clerical work, basic tech support, writing. Somewhere in there, I helped a couple of people with their websites, even though Iâ€™d missed a whole lot of the evolution of the Web. (Iâ€™m not at all sorry to have skipped Flash.) I was feeling considerably better thanks to new medication, and easing my way toward being self-supporting, but at the time I discovered WordPress in 2005, I was suffering from a bad case of Multiple Business Personality Disorder. I had a number of useful skills, but no clear focus or unifying principle.</p>\n<p>I had started my first blog on Blogger in January 2005, but within a few months I found myself hanging out with a lot of podcasters, and almost all of them used WordPress because the PodPress plugin (RIP) made it so easy to publish feeds with enclosures. I started to explore WordPress further, and within a few years had migrated my blog from Blogger because they stopped allowing you to self-host your blog. WordPress had meanwhile introduced pages, making it possible to build an entire website rather than having an HTML website and a WordPress blog.</p>\n<h3>Finding Community</h3>\n<p>But WordPress would probably have remained a sideline if I hadnâ€™t started going to WordPress meetups. I was at a podcasting meetup in San Francisco in late 2008 when someone mentioned a WordPress meetup in SF. I went to a meeting (I think in January 2009) and someone THERE mentioned that there was a WordPress meetup starting in the East Bay, closer to where I lived. I went to that meeting in February 2009â€¦and the rest is history.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It wasnâ€™t that the first meetup was such an amazing experience. The organizer was new at running a meetup and we were all strangers to each other. But somehow talking about our shared interest in WordPress just made us more interested.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Iâ€™ve always been a service junkie, and Iâ€™d been involved with other networking groups for years, so it wasnâ€™t long before I found myself co-organizer, helping to plan and run the meetup and welcoming new members as they joined. Through the meetup, I started to learn more about the WordPress community and open source software. A group of us went to WordCamp SF 2009.</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/WordCampSF-2010-min.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2019\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/WordCampSF-2010-min.jpg\" alt=\"East Bay WordPress Meetup members at WCSF 2010\" width=\"1776\" height=\"2336\" /></a>East Bay WordPress Meetup members at WCSF 2010\n<p>Because of the meetup, I made more and more connections in the wider WordPress community. Because of the meetup, I learned a lot more about WordPress than I would have on my own, in part because I often had to teach it. Because of the meetup, more WordPress-related work came to me. I started to learn more code, little bits and fragments at a time. WordPress drew me in deeper and deeper as time progressed. In 2012, I officially registered WP Fangirl, and since that time, almost all my income has come from WordPress work.</p>\n<h3>All the WordCamps</h3>\n<p>I went to all the San Francisco WordCamps between 2009 and 2014, after which WordCamp US was instituted. By the time the first WordCamp Sacramento was announced in 2015, all the meetup presentations Iâ€™d done gave me the confidence to submit a talk. It was accepted. Iâ€™ve since spoken at WCLAX 2016 and WCSAC 2016. Iâ€™m working on my presentation for WCSAC 2017. (Iâ€™d love to travel for more meetups, but itâ€™s not in the budget.)</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Sallie_Goetsch-min.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2021\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Sallie_Goetsch-min.jpg\" alt=\"Speaking at WordCamp LAX 2016\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1086\" /></a>Speaking at WordCamp LAX 2016\n<p>The experience I had with the Meetup made me want to connect more and more with other WordPress people, and to help out where I could. As I said, Iâ€™m a service junkie, so I readily embraced the idea of giving back to the community. Iâ€™m not a good enough developer (yet, anyway) to be a core contributor, but there are lots of ways to contribute. The main one, in my case, is organizing the meetup, though it took me until 2016 to join the official WordPress Community meetup program.</p>\n<p>I was also very active in the main WordPress LinkedIn group for several years, which led to Oâ€™Reilly hiring me as the technical reviewer for WordPress: The Missing Manual. (It may also have contributed to the gig I had in 2011 making WordPress videos for Peachpit Press and the one in 2012 and 2013 teaching WordPress for Mediabistro.)</p>\n<p>I started listening to WordPress podcasts in about 2006, though WP Weekly is the only one of those early shows thatâ€™s still around. There are tons of new WP podcasts now, more than I can keep up with. I got invited to participate in one, the WP-Tonic panel, starting in 2015. You can hear me being mouthy and opinionated there almost every week. I follow WordPress people on Twitter, belong to WordPress Slack teams, and have been known to dream about WordPress.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the WordPress meetup, I found focus, fun, friends, and what passes for fame. Iâ€™m still working on fortune, but I can tell you that the secret to the many great referrals Iâ€™ve gotten from my extensive network of WordPress connections is this: donâ€™t go into it looking for what you can get. Just concentrate on what you can give, and never stop learning.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: WordPress Ate My Lifeâ€”In a Good Way\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=WordPress%20Ate%20My%20Life%E2%80%94In%20a%20Good%20Way&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-ate-life-good-way%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: WordPress Ate My Lifeâ€”In a Good Way\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-ate-life-good-way%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-ate-life-good-way%2F&title=WordPress+Ate+My+Life%E2%80%94In+a+Good+Way\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: WordPress Ate My Lifeâ€”In a Good Way\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-ate-life-good-way/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/080917-min-150x150.jpg&description=WordPress Ate My Lifeâ€”In a Good Way\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: WordPress Ate My Lifeâ€”In a Good Way\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-ate-life-good-way/\" title=\"WordPress Ate My Lifeâ€”In a Good Way\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-ate-life-good-way/\">WordPress Ate My Lifeâ€”In a Good Way</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Aug 2017 12:00:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Sallie Goetsch\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"Post Status: Live from Publish: Challenges facing the WordPress Economy â€” Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=38415\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"https://poststatus.com/live-publish-challenges-facing-wordpress-economy-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1739:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

The team is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952#issuecomment-320644682\">considering various solutions</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952#issuecomment-320638392\">some </a>have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottkclark/status/894488147966517248\">suggested</a> that a Fields API in core would have made the future of meta boxes less of an issue.</p>\n<p>I reached out to <a href=\"https://www.scottkclark.com/\">Scott Kingsley Clark</a>, lead developer ofÂ the <a title=\"Pods Framework for WordPress\" href=\"http://pods.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pods Framework</a> and one of the main contributors to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/fields-api/\">Fields API project</a>. Clark explains what the Fields API is, its current status, its relationship to the meta box discussions, and how to contribute.</p>\n<p><strong>For those who don&#8217;t know, what is the Fields API project? How would it impact users?</strong></p>\n<p>Itâ€™s a <a href=\"https://github.com/sc0ttkclark/wordpress-fields-api\">feature proposal</a> for WordPress core to allow registering fields to different screens in the admin area through a single API. For posts, this would add new meta boxes and fields within them. For users, it would add new sections and fields to the profile screen. The goal is to integrate with all of the different admin screens including, Posts, Terms, Users, Media, and Comments.</p>\n<p>Typical users would notice that the fields added by plugins they are using all have a similar look and feel. Thatâ€™s really an oversimplification of whatâ€™s going on behind the scenes, but itâ€™s one of the big benefits as well, since it shouldnâ€™t really affect end-users beyond improving consistency of different screens and potential redesigns.</p>\n<p><strong>What has caused progress on the project to slow down?</strong></p>\n<p>I was out-of-town for a all-hands company meetup, lead organized WordCamp Dallas-Fort Worth 2016, and ran PodsCamp 2016 in Austin, TX, all in the span of about a month and a half. It was intense, but somehow last summer I thought I could manage moving too.</p>\n<p>We were in the process of showing our house, almost all of the time, so that we could sell it. The buying process was full of thorns, with a move that was pretty fun. I also started a new job at Modern Tribe in February, 2017.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, yes that was way too much but the challenge was met and the only thing that suffered was the Fields API project, which was no easy feat. Itâ€™s unfortunate, but Iâ€™m glad to be getting back into things again this month.</p>\n<p><strong>Are new contributors showing a renewed interest in the project?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. We recently had a few people become interested in helping. When Iâ€™ve got help, Iâ€™m 300% more productive. Itâ€™s much easier to bounce ideas off of others with shared experience than it is going alone.</p>\n<p><strong>How does the API relate to how meta boxes could be handled in Gutenberg? If the API were in core, how would it influence the discussion?</strong></p>\n<p>Hereâ€™s where the irony sets in. If we were successful in getting a Fields API into WordPress before Gutenberg was a thing, the ability for Gutenberg to revamp as much as it has planned to revamp in the post editor, would not be as hindered as it is now.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem I see facing Gutenberg is reining in the scope that covers meta boxes. They need to get things working for meta boxes that are already being registered and used by plugin developers.</p>\n<p>If Fields API were a part of WordPress, they would still need to keep backwards compatibility but I could easily add a meta box with my fields into the proposed Gutenberg meta boxes (still in discussion) with just a few lines of code. Plus, my fields and meta boxes registered using the Fields API would work just fine on pre-Gutenberg sites.</p>\n<p>Another parallel here would be the User edit screen, which has had <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/03/fields-api-request-for-review-of-direction/\">much discussion</a> about revamping the way it looks. Itâ€™s very difficult to revamp it and give it consistency without a Fields API already in place. It&#8217;s not impossible, but many problems come to the surface during any approach to &#8216;React-ify&#8217; it, utilize meta boxes, or whatever it would use.</p>\n<p><strong>How can people get involved/contribute to the Fields API project?</strong></p>\n<p>Iâ€™m very excited to have others interested in moving the project along.

This is very worrying for the future of WordPress as a CMS.&#8221;</p>\n<p>James Nylen, one of the lead developers on the project, reassured followers of the topic that the Gutenberg team has not forgotten about the issue but rather that it is &#8220;an extremely complicated issue that we are only beginning to look into, along with many, many other priorities for getting the editor working well.&#8221; He also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952#issuecomment-320523428\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a> for help from the community in planning and testing implementations for supporting meta boxes.</p>\n<p>This response left many things unclear. Participants in the discussion, many of whom are developers concerned about about the prospect of having to rewrite all of their meta boxes as React components, are wondering why meta boxes cannot work alongside the new Gutenberg editor and why the team chose to include meta boxes in the scope of the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Is it possible to replace the existing TinyMCE post editor with Gutenberg while leaving the rest of the interface, including meta boxes and existing hooks, unchanged?&#8221; Kevin Hoffman asked. When Nylen clarified that Gutenberg, as written today, is intended to be a <code>post_content</code> editor, Hoffman summarized the concerns that many developers have expressed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If Gutenberg is truly intended to be a <code>post_content</code> editor, then meta boxes should be left alone as they are not concerned with <code>post_content</code>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore the need for an API to translate PHP meta boxes into React meta boxes is a manufactured problem. It does not have to be a problem, but it has become a problem because somewhere along the line it was decided that rewriting the <code>post_content</code> editor should also completely change how meta boxes work.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve outlined the tremendous challenge of writing such an API in <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2251\" target=\"_blank\">#2251</a>. Translating PHP meta boxes into React for a popular custom fields solution like ACF is challenging enough, let alone trying to do so for every meta box implementation that exists today, popular or not. It does not scale.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As the Gutenberg contributors shared that they have only just begun to look into the meta box issue, it&#8217;s now clear why there is no roadmap for how the project will handle &#8220;legacy&#8221; PHP meta boxes. In July, Nylen said, &#8220;If I had to guess where we will end up here: current metaboxes will be moved to a &#8220;legacy&#8221; area and we will provide APIs, documentation, and examples for registering &#8216;new-style&#8217; metabox-block-thingies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Plugin developers who manage meta box libraries, agencies, and other concerned parties are following the ticket to find out how to plan for the WordPress 5.0, which has been targeted as the Gutenberg release. Andrey Savchenko <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952#issuecomment-320574699\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a> if WordPress plans to formally deprecate the meta box API, which finally drew a clear answer from the team. Matias Ventura <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952#issuecomment-320644682\" target=\"_blank\">responded</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Does WordPress intend to formally deprecate Metabox API?&#8221;</strong><br />\nNo.</p>\n<p>The question that is not fully answered yet is how do meta-boxes work in the context of the Gutenberg editor. Should they remain the same or evolve? How can we move towards the design goals with the least amount of disruption possible?</p>\n<p>This issue has been lingering not due to a lack of desire, but lack of resources. The primary focus for this project is to offer a rich content editing interface that optimizes for direct manipulation of user content through the notion of blocks. (Having used meta-boxes extensively for various projects, I believe blocks can offer a better step forwards for many of those needs while providing a better user experience.)&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ventura listed several options the team has considered for handling meta boxes and requested help from the community to build the best solution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we detect a meta-box is registered we can fallback to the old interface, nothing changes.</li>\n<li>We could split editing the content and modifying meta information into two screens or stages.</li>\n<li>We can try to see how feasible it is to render these as they are (PHP) below the content: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2251\" target=\"_blank\">#2251</a>.</li>\n<li>A theme/plugin/CPT could unregister the new interface as needed.</li>\n<li>Various items that relied on meta boxes could be converted to blocks for UI (still storing data separately).</li>\n<li>We could implement API based meta boxes extensibility like the Fields API.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When pressed to answer the question of why meta boxes are being included in the context of the new editor, Gutenberg design lead Joen Asmussen clarified how the team decided to include meta boxes in the scope of the project:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Gutenberg did start just with the editor box. The kickoff goal was to unify multiple disparate interfaces under a single unified block interface. It quickly become apparent that in order for us to create a compelling experience revolving around this unified block interface, we had to consider the full writing flow, including settings and publishing.</p>\n<p>If the key strength of WordPress is to make it easy for anyone to create rich posts, then we can&#8217;t just design for those of us who already know how to use the editor. We have to consider users who&#8217;ve never used WordPress before, and what they expect in a modern publishing interface. Otherwise we&#8217;d just be adding cognitive load to an already heavy interface.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The question of how meta boxes will fit into the context of the Gutenberg editor is still open. Participants in the discussion are eager to have this question answered for the sake of backwards compatibility and also because it affects ongoing decisions regarding Gutenberg development and screen design.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I completely get how much work has been done towards the &#8216;screen&#8217; replacement approach,&#8221; Xavi Ivars <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952#issuecomment-320771891\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the issue. &#8220;But shouldn&#8217;t a project that started with the goal of a &#8216;post content editor&#8217; replacement, have gone back to the community before deciding unilaterally that it would replace the whole editor screen?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The meta box API isn&#8217;t being deprecated but there&#8217;s also no clear path forward for how Gutenberg will support &#8220;legacy&#8221; PHP meta boxes. The Gutenberg team said the issue has not been solved due to lack of resources. The project needs community input and better communication if the team is going to land on a solution that will seamlessly usher the majority of WordPress sites into the Gutenberg era with the least amount of breakage.</p>\n<p>Currently, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2251\" target=\"_blank\">the feasibility of rendering legacy PHP meta boxes below the content</a> is fraught with challenges and still up for debate. If there isn&#8217;t enough time or client resources for developers to rewrite their work into JS-driven meta boxes, then a clear path for opting out of the Gutenberg interface may be necessary for sites that need to preserve the legacy &#8220;PHP&#8221; meta boxes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 08 Aug 2017 19:54:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.7.0 Adds Opt-In Usage Tracking\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73912\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-7-0-adds-opt-in-usage-tracking\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6304:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/04/whats-new-in-gutenberg-4th-august/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 0.7.0</a> was released just before the weekend with improvements to the writing flow and greater flexibility for theme authors to add their own customizations. Last week&#8217;s version 0.6.0 release made significant changes to the way paragraphs are created within text blocks, allowing for blocks to split when pressing enter. However, it inserted a &#8220;New Paragraph&#8221; placeholder that was distracting for users trying to stay in the flow of writing.</p>\n<p>Version 0.7.0 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2161\" target=\"_blank\">hides placeholders on focus</a>, providing a cleaner experience of starting a new paragraph. After a user has already intuitively initiated a new paragraph by pressing enter, the &#8220;New Paragraph&#8221; placeholder holds little value. Removing the placeholder is a minor improvement that brings Gutenberg closer to providing a better experience for long-form writing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/new-paragraph-gutenberg-0-7-0.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also introduces <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2186\" target=\"_blank\">theme support for customized color palettes and a shared component</a>, such as cover text and button blocks. The sample code below shows how easy it would be for theme authors to implement their own color palettes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/theme-support-color-palette.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg contributors have also added <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2021\" target=\"_blank\">theme support for wide images</a>. According to the inline docs, this allows for some blocks, such as the image block, to define a &#8220;wide&#8221; or &#8220;full&#8221; alignment by adding the corresponding classname to the block&#8217;s wrapper ( <code>alignwide</code> or <code>alignfull</code> ).</p>\n<p>These additions offer theme developers a better picture of where Gutenberg is headed in regards to themes. The plugin&#8217;s contributors are slowly building in more points of customization so that theme authors can add or override Gutenberg&#8217;s styles and provide additional opt-in features to their users.</p>\n<p>Theme support for wide images has already been committed to Tammie Lister&#8217;s experimental <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg-theme\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg Theme</a>. The project was created to showcase how Gutenberg will interact with WordPress themes and is still a work in progress.</p>\n<h3>Gutenberg Adds Opt-In Data Collection</h3>\n<p>After updating the Gutenberg plugin to 0.7.0 and navigating to the editor, users are presented with the option to opt into data collection about their usage of the editor. The usage data, which is anonymous and does not include post content, is sent to WordPress.com for future analysis. Gutenberg contributor James Nylen explained how the data tracking works in a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/06/opt-in-usage-tracking-in-gutenberg/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on Make.WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Gutenberg plugin contains a mechanism to count how often specific actions occur over time,&#8221; Nylen said. &#8220;If the user has previously clicked &#8216;Yes&#8217; on this screen, and an event occurs that has an associated <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=bumpStat&type=\" target=\"_blank\">bumpStat call</a> in the Gutenberg code, then this event is sent to WordPress.com servers by loading a special &#8216;pixel&#8217; image.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg&#8217;s tracking code stores the â€œgroupâ€� and â€œnameâ€� sent with the bumpStat call (short strings of text), along with the time the event was recorded. Nylen said the team will use the data to improve the editor based on usage patterns. This data collection information is currently only available to those with access to WordPress.com servers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As Gutenberg is an open-source community project, we view this data as belonging to the WordPress community, so we also plan to make this data available via a public dashboard,&#8221; Nylen said.</p>\n<p>He shared an example of the data that has been collected from the plugin over the past few days since 0.7.0 was released. This chart is a preview of the number and types of blocks that users have added to posts while testing the editor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gutenberg-add-block-total-e1502130689795.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The approach taken here is very similar to Calypso&#8217;s event tracking code,&#8221; Nylen said in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2140\" target=\"_blank\">pull request for adding the data collection</a>. &#8220;We can use the data added in this PR to inform various decisions such as default order for blocks and whether some blocks are less suitable for core, and more generally this is a very useful technique to collect user experience data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The majority of Gutenberg&#8217;s chief contributors are Automattic employees, so it makes sense that they would use the options and infrastructure available to them to quickly get data collection going in Gutenberg. However, the data from these tests needs to be shared with the greater WordPress community as soon as possible, since it is being collected in the name of the WordPress project. Ideally, it would have been set up to be displayed publicly before asking users to opt into the collection.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg contributors are also considering making the data collection more modular so that it could be used with other WordPress feature plugins or existing features in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maybe the tracking could be its own module, it could be useful outside of the editor (and other WP feature plugins later),&#8221; Riad Benguella <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2140#discussion_r130839438\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;Longer term (or not), WP.org needs its own tracking infrastructure and this could be very useful to enhance WordPress.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 07 Aug 2017 20:05:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"WPTavern: Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Dismisses Automatticâ€™s Trademark Dispute Against Chris Pearson\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73899\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:115:\"https://wptavern.com/trademark-trial-and-appeal-board-dismisses-automattics-trademark-dispute-against-chris-pearson\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4131:\"<p>In July 2015, Automattic <a href=\"http://www.adrforum.com/domaindecisions/1613723.htm\">won its <span class=\"_Tgc\"> Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy</span> (UDRP) case</a> against <a href=\"http://www.pearsonified.com/\">Chris Pearson</a> regarding Thesis.com after the <a href=\"http://www.adrforum.com/domaindecisions/1613723.htm\">panel determined</a> that he failed to establish all three elements required under the ICANN Policy.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A party must satisfy all three of the burdens imposed under the Policy in order for the Panel to order transfer of a domain name from the entity registering it.

Automattic retaliated by <a href=\"http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92061714&pty=CAN&eno=1\">filing a petition</a> for cancellation with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In the petition, Automattic argued that the three trademarks owned by Pearson, DIYTHEMES, THESIS THEME, and THESIS, should be cancelled.</p>\n<p>For the past two years, legal teams for both parties have gone back and forth filing briefs, requests for extensions, and other documents. Earlier this year on April 20th, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board <a href=\"http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92061714&pty=CAN&eno=19\">dismissed the case</a> citing a lack of evidence and testimony from Automattic that establishes real interest and a reasonable belief in damages.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The record is devoid of any evidence concerning the nature of Petitionerâ€™s (Automattic) commercial activities and its interest in Respondentâ€™s (Chris Pearson) registered marks.

Thus, on the record before us, Petitioner has failed to establish a &#8216;real interest&#8217; and &#8216;reasonable belief in damage.&#8217; Accordingly, the cancellation proceeding is dismissed for Petitionerâ€™s lack of standing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On May 22nd,<a href=\"http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92061714&pty=CAN&eno=20\"> Automattic filed a motion</a> for the board to reconsider its decision.

Yes, segments of it are and will continue to do so. Itâ€™s like in any industry: the car replaced the horse and the robot replaced the factory worker.

In early 2016, Medium convinced a collection of small, independent publications to move to its platform but shortly thereafter discontinued its unsuccessful ad-driven publishing model <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/when-you-launch-your-publication-the-same-day-medium-changes\" target=\"_blank\">without notifying publishers</a>.</p>\n<p>In March 2017, Medium CEO Ev Williams announced that his solution to fix the broken, ad-driven media industry was to fire up <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/medium-aims-to-fix-broken-media-with-new-5-subscription-program\" target=\"_blank\">a new $5 subscription program</a> that would put articles behind a paywall inside of the Medium network.</p>\n<p>Today The Awl, The Hairpin, and The Billfold announced the publications have <a href=\"https://www.theawl.com/2017/08/somethings-different/\" target=\"_blank\">moved back to WordPress</a> after switching to Medium in April 2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The move to Medium was a cool experiment, in my opinion, but the year is up and personally I missed the ads,&#8221; The Awl Editor Silvia Killingsworth said. <a href=\"https://www.thebillfold.com/2017/08/change-is-the-only-constant-in-life/\" target=\"_blank\">The Billfold&#8217;s announcement</a> cited Mediums&#8217; recent changes as the reason for the move back to WordPress:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our move to Medium was an experiment to explore a different kind of business model, and that experiment is over now that the platform has moved in a different direction (<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/publishers-flee-medium-amid-business-model-changes-2440471520.html\" target=\"_blank\">you can read more in-depth about those changes here</a>).</p>\n<p>Adapting to change is all part of the many joys of being a small, independent publisher.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Film School Rejects Returns to WordPress After 1-Year Experiment with Medium</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/what-happened-with-medium/\" target=\"_blank\">Film School Rejects (FSR) also returned to WordPress in May</a> after a year-long, rocky experiment with Medium. The publication was one of Medium&#8217;s first 12 premium publishers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, I can&#8217;t afford, nor would my heart hold up for, a move back to a private server and WordPress,&#8221; FSR founder Neil Miller <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/2017/why-publishers-are-sticking-with-medium-for-now/444507/\" target=\"_blank\">told Poynter in January</a> after Medium announced it was pivoting away from ad-driven media. &#8220;So, barring a miracle, my site will live and die on Medium. I&#8217;m optimistic that I&#8217;ll find some sort of solution and be able to remain on Medium.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Medium&#8217;s goals as a publisher of subscription content were at odds with FSR&#8217;s ability to sustain the publication. Miller said they had ported 10 years of content over to the platform after being promised a beautiful user experience and a way forward that would allow FSR to grown the business, continue to pay its writers, and keep the publication on the cutting edge.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What we were sold when we joined their platform is very different from what they&#8217;re offering as a way forward,&#8221; Miller told Poynter. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost as if Ev Williams wasn&#8217;t concerned that he was pulling out the rug from underneath publishers who had placed their trust in his vision for the future of journalism.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After moving FSR back to WordPress, Miller said the partnership with Medium was great until the company changed course to become a different type of platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As time went on, it became clear that Mediumâ€™s priorities had shifted from being a platform for independent publishers to being itself a publisher of premium, subscription-based content,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As we learned more about their future plans for the now-existent Medium â€˜Members Onlyâ€™ program, it became clear that our site wouldnâ€™t be able to continue to operate the way we always had.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Miller said the process of trying a new platform and returning to WordPress made him realize that he &#8220;missed some of the customizable features of WordPress,&#8221; which led his team to work on some new features they will be launching in the future. The site has reinstated its banner advertising on pages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Weâ€™d love to be able to do this all without any ads, but thereâ€™s no money in that,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;And guess who doesnâ€™t get paid if the site canâ€™t make any money? The people who write articles, edit the site, make video essays, curate One Perfect Shot, and host podcasts.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>ThinkProgress Exits Medium, Founder Says Platform is No Longer Developed with Publishers in Mind</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ThinkProgress</a> was one of the largest publications to make the move to Medium last August. After less than a year, the site has moved back to WordPress, its previous publishing platform. ThinkProgress founder Judd Legum told <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/2017/with-big-plans-to-staff-up-thinkprogress-is-leaving-medium-behind-update/465424/\" target=\"_blank\">Poynter</a> that the lack of advertising capabilities was not the reason his publication left the platform but rather because Medium no longer serves the best interests of publishers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m certainly not eager to have a bunch of ads on the site â€” and we&#8217;re not going to,&#8221; Legum said. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to have none. And if it were possible, I&#8217;d be interested in figuring out a model where we don&#8217;t have to have any. But if it&#8217;s connected to a platform that&#8217;s not going to be developed with publishers in mind, it doesn&#8217;t really make sense to think through that as a platform. That sealed it for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>ThinkProgress is taking its 8 to 10 million unique pageviews per month back into the independent publishing space. It is the latest of several other publishers leaving Medium after having been persuaded in 2016 to jump into Ev Williams&#8217; experiment with initial promises of free hosting, more traffic, and advertising money. Not all of the sites are moving back to WordPress, but most are looking to free themselves from Medium&#8217;s experiment on publishers and regain the ability to sell advertising and/or subscriptions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/bill-simmons-moves-the-ringer-from-medium-to-vox-media-2426770782.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Ringer moved to Vox Media</a> at the end of May after Medium discontinued its advertising model. <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/2017/after-being-wooed-by-medium-some-publishers-are-beginning-to-leave/459998/\" target=\"_blank\">The Pacific Standard left Medium</a> to focus on building custom features to drive subscription growth.</p>\n<p>Backchannel also moved its site off of the platform and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/backchannel-is-moving-to-wired\" target=\"_blank\">is now publishing on Wired.com</a>. &#8220;In the time since Backchannel launched, Medium has shifted its business strategy, and itâ€™s no longer as focused on helping publications like ours profit,&#8221; BackChannel Editor Jessi Hempel said.</p>\n<p>Medium&#8217;s new <a href=\"https://medium.com/membership\" target=\"_blank\">subscription revenue model</a> and partner program are still in beta but the returns have not been enough to convince publishers to stay, even with costly migrations back to tried and proven platforms like WordPress. Ad-driven publishing may not be the most ideal way to keep a publication afloat, but publishers moving away from Medium are not willing to stay on for the the startup&#8217;s experiment at the expense of their writers and staff.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 04 Aug 2017 23:09:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8.1 Released, Adds Custom HTML Widget\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73825\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-1-released-adds-custom-html-widget\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:901:\"<p>WordPress 4.8.1 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/wordpress-4-8-1-maintenance-release/\">is available for download</a> or as an update from the WordPress Dashboard.

The success of previous events has generated momentum to continue the 24-hour global translation sprints and has also increased the visibility of the Polyglots team&#8217;s contributions. These sprints have provided a catalyst for the team&#8217;s growth from 5,000 contributors in April 2015 to 17,000 in November 2016. The greater WordPress community has also grown in tandem, as reliable translations are the lifeblood of international WordPress usage.</p>\n<p>One way of measuring the growth of the global community is the checking the status of local meetups. After the addition of the dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8, the community has seen a sharp rise in <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">meetup group</a> growth, according to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">recent stats</a> from the community team. The widget displays local WordPress events for logged-in users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Itâ€™s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably â€” since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program,&#8221; Hugh Lashbrooke said. &#8220;This is compared to 19 new groups and only 7,071 new members in the same time period last year.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wordpress-meetups.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Much of that growth can be attributed to the growth of the international WordPress community, which has continued to advance the concept of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/07/18/regional-camps-take-2/\" target=\"_blank\">regional WordCamps</a> for countries and continents. These include events such as WordCamp Netherlands, WordCamp Europe, and the planned WordCamp Asia, that bring larger groups of WordPress enthusiasts together around a common region.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the WordPress community hosted 80 WordCamps in 29 countries. At the conclusion of 2016, there were 115 total WordCamps hosted in 41 different countries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress&#8217; usage</a> continues to grow every year, and the percentage of non-English-speaking users is also expanding. In 2014, non-English WordPress downloads surpassed English downloads for the first time.</p>\n<p>Last July, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-stats-page-redesigned-adds-new-data-on-installs-by-langauge\" target=\"_blank\">53.9% of WordPress sites used the English (US) locale</a>. That number has dropped to 50% as of today, as international usage continues to rise.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wordpress-locales-july-2017.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Stats from WordPress.org July 2017\n<p>Rahul Bansal&#8217;s lightning talk at WordCamp Europe identified one example of <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2017/06/21/rahul-bansal-how-translation-sprints-helps-bring-in-new-contributors/\" target=\"_blank\">how the translation sprints are bringing in new contributors in India</a>. In the past, meetup groups have had a problem with retaining new users, who often come to their first meetup lacking both a sense of belonging and confidence in contributing. Bansal and other Polyglots members had an idea to remove this block to contributing by getting new users involved in translating WordPress.</p>\n<p>During the last global translation day event, Bansal helped organize a local group to translate WordPress core into Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati. They also translated the subtitles for the WordPress 4.6 release video. The key was that the leaders did not participate in translating strings but rather focused on guiding new translators &#8211; 90% ended up being first-time contributors.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.6 shipped with support for 50 languages and the complete Gujarati translation was added to core just a few days before the release. Its inclusion in the release made WordPress more accessible to approximately 65.5 million Gujarati speakers worldwide.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrap\"></div>\n<p>The 3rd Global WordPress Translation Day falls on the same day that the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/ga11914.doc.htm\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations has designated as International Translation Day</a>, a new initiative to recognize &#8220;the role of professional translation in connection with nations and fostering peace, understanding, and development.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress has only just begun to explore its potential to democratize publishing and hasn&#8217;t even cracked the ice in terms of usage across the world&#8217;s most popular languages. Sites using the various Chinese and Arabic locales make up less than 2% of international usage, despite these languages having more than a billion native speakers combined. If WordPress adoption takes off in these parts of the world, it will create a whole new wave of contribution and vastly expand the world market for commercial plugins and themes. The Polyglots team are on the forefront of making this possible.</p>\n<p>The first two WPTranslationDay events were held in April and November of 2016. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/2nd-global-wordpress-translation-day-brings-780-translators-together-across-133-locales\" target=\"_blank\">second event had a 74% increase in participation over the first</a> with a total of 780 translators participating.

Iâ€™m a female developer but Iâ€™ve never really felt like that is anything too special and more importantly I have rarely felt like my gender mattered.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As a kid I thought I would become an artist or a dancer. It wasnâ€™t until I had to choose the university to apply to that I decided to go with something more practical so I went with Computer Science. I hadnâ€™t really done much with code before that, except for having a Lord of the Rings discussion board with my friends and making doing some HTML &amp; CSS related to that. After the first year of school I was already making my first WordPress sites to paying customers.</p>\n<p>After graduating I have been a full-time employee in a developer position as well as a freelancer. Iâ€™ve worked both in Finland and in the USA. During my career I have actually been surprised how easy it has been for me, a woman in the male-dominated industry, to find work, to get promoted and to get recognition. I have not faced much discrimination or prejudice related to my gender, and the great professionals I have got to work with have always been interested in my skills beyond anything else.</p>\n<p>So how come there is such a huge gender gap in the industry? Iâ€™ve witnessed it myself many times &#8211; being the only woman in a WordPress meetup of thirty people, or not having to queue at all to womenâ€™s bathroom in a tech conference with over 1000 attendees. There is no doubt that women are as capable as men, so whatever the reason is I really hope the future women would see the fun, problem-solving profession of a programmer as a great career option.</p>\n<h3>A few tips for an aspiring developer</h3>\n<p>I want to encourage everyone considering a developer career to take action and go for it. The tech industry is full of very clever and inspiring people and I promise you will not be bored. More importantly it is a safe career choice: the job market is great and the companies and the different tech communities are generally very open and welcoming. If you want to be a woman person in tech, remember:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do not accept <del>gender</del> any discrimination</strong><br />\nOne great thing about being a developer is the current status of the job market. There is a lot more demand than there is supply, so you can choose who you work with. Do not put up with discrimination, talk about it openly and stand against it. Iâ€™ve been lucky enough not to face much judgement based on my gender. Iâ€™ve worked both in Finland and in the US and the biggest challenges Iâ€™ve faced have been clients that have been surprised that a woman is the tech lead in their project. Usually after a few hours of working together the prejudice disappears &#8211; it has always been enough to just be professional and stay true to myself.</li>\n<li><strong>Be active and give back</strong><br />\nIt is important to be active in your community and help other people out in their careers. Everyone benefits from a striving local community and also it is a great opportunity to make new connections and open new doors in your career.Being an organiser of WordCamp Finland &amp; WordPress Helsinki meetup group for the last few years has really given me more than it has taken. Iâ€™ve learnt a lot and met many inspiring people, and it has opened up new career options for me too. The best thing tho has been just seeing the Finnish community grow so much and get more active by the day.</li>\n<li><strong>It&#8217;s skills that matter</strong><br />\nThis is really what it comes down to. Are you developing your skills constantly? Are you willing to keep up with the industry? You do not have to be the best developer, but you should be confident in your skills and be willing to always learn new ones. I believe that this is the only thing that matters in the end &#8211; not your gender.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Your%20Skills%20Speak%20Louder%20Than%20Your%20Gender&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fskills-speak-louder-gender%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fskills-speak-louder-gender%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fskills-speak-louder-gender%2F&title=Your+Skills+Speak+Louder+Than+Your+Gender\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/skills-speak-louder-gender/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/080217-min-150x150.jpg&description=Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/skills-speak-louder-gender/\" title=\"Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/skills-speak-louder-gender/\">Your Skills Speak Louder Than Your Gender</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 11:00:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Sonja Jaakkola\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: July 2017\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4885\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5687:\"<p>After a particularly busy month <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2017/\">in June</a>, things settled down a bit in the WordPress world â€” WordPress 4.8â€™s release went very smoothly, allowing the Core team to build up some of the community infrastructure around development. Read on for more interesting news from around the WordPress world in July.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Weekly meeting for new core contributors</h2>\n<p>Onboarding new contributors is a persistent issue for most WordPress contribution teams. While every team welcomes any new contributors, the path to getting deeply involved can be tricky to find at times.</p>\n<p>This month, the Core team implemented a fantastic new initiative: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/announcing-a-weekly-new-contributors-meeting/\">weekly meetings for new core contributors</a> as a way to encourage involvement and foster fresh contributions. The meetings not only focus on bugs suited to first-time contributors, they also make space for experienced contributors to help out individuals who may be new to developing WordPress core.</p>\n<p>The meetings are held every Wednesday at 19:00 UTC in the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Increased focus on PHP practices in WordPress core</h2>\n<p>In bringing people together to improve WordPress core, a new channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> named #core-php is designed to focus on PHP development in the project.</p>\n<p>Along with this increased concentration on PHP, a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/06/announcement-for-weekly-php-meetings/\">new weekly meeting is now taking place</a> every Monday at 18:00 UTC in #core-php to improve WordPress coreâ€™s PHP practices.</p>\n<h2>Sharp rise in meetup group growth</h2>\n<p>The dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8 displays local, upcoming WordPress events for the logged in user. The events listed in this widget are pulled from the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">meetup chapter program</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule\">WordCamp schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>This widget provides greater visibility of official WordPress events, and encourages community involvement in these events. Itâ€™s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably â€” since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program. This is compared to 19 new groups and only 7,071 new members in the same time period last year.</p>\n<p>You can find a local meetup group to join <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">on meetup.com</a>, and if you would like to get involved in organizing events for your community, you can find out more about the inner workings of the program <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/\">on the Community Team site</a> or by joining the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8.1 due for imminent release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 cycleâ€™s first maintenance release will be published in the coming week, more than a month after 4.8 was released. This release fix some important issues in WordPress core and the majority of users will find that their sites will update to this new version automatically.</p>\n<p>If you would like to help out by testing this release before it goes live, you can follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/beta/\">beta testing guide</a> for WordPress core. To get further involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The WordPress mobile apps have been updated with <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/07/24/a-brand-new-editor-for-the-wordpress-mobile-apps/\">a brand new text editor</a>.</li>\n<li>In a recent push to encourage WordPress users to upgrade their PHP versions, two features have been proposed &#8211; one <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41191\">to provide a notice to users</a> and another to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934\">allow PHP version requirements to be specified by plugins and themes</a>.</li>\n<li>John Maeda wrote <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2017/07/14/whywordpress2/\">a great post</a> celebrating the freedom that WordPress offers.</li>\n<li>Gutenberg, the new text editor for WordPress, is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/28/whats-new-in-gutenberg-28th-july/\">in continual development</a> â€” everyone is invited to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">test it out</a>.</li>\n<li>The WordPress Meta team is starting <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2017/07/26/experiment-wordcamp-org-bug-scrubs/\">a new initiative</a> to bring the community together to focus on fixing bugs across the WordCamp.org network.</li>\n<li>Volunteer applications for WordCamp US <a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/2017/08/01/wcus-needs-you-volunteer-applications-are-now-open/\">are now open</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next â€œMonth in WordPressâ€� post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 07:50:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Hugh Lashbrooke\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 5.2 Brings Major Improvements to the Contact Form Module\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73816\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-5-2-brings-major-improvements-to-the-contact-form-module\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2280:\"<p>Jetpack&#8217;s <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/contact-form/\" target=\"_blank\">Contact Form module</a> hasn&#8217;t seen too many changes since its first release (<a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2012/04/24/jetpack-1-3-released-contact-forms/\" target=\"_blank\">version 1.3</a>) in 2012.

WordPress&#8217; notification system is often abused and overused by plugin authors who want to inject upsells and announcements into the admin. These can stack up like a pile of junk mail vying for users&#8217; attention when they are trying to manage their sites. Ultimately, notice overload decreases users&#8217; enjoyment of the software and may contribute to making it a chore to log into WordPress.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dobby/\" target=\"_blank\">Dobby plugin</a> from <a href=\"https://tfrommen.de\" target=\"_blank\">Thorsten Frommen</a> attempts to solve this problem by capturing and hiding unwanted admin notices. Frommen, a WordPress engineer at Inpsyde, was inspired to create the plugin after he saw a recent tweet from Torsten Landsiedel showing &#8220;Everyday life in the WordPress dashboard.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"de\" dir=\"ltr\">Alltag im WordPress Dashboard. <a href=\"https://t.co/lofO7544uL\">pic.twitter.com/lofO7544uL</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Torsten Landsiedel (@zodiac1978) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zodiac1978/status/886646392730648577\">July 16, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dobby rolls up WordPress admin notices and keeps them hidden behind a &#8220;Reveal&#8221; button that toggles a color-coded list of notices into view. It captures all the notices that are printed via the admin notice hooks, such as <code>network_admin_notices</code>, <code>user_admin_notices</code>, <code>admin_notices</code> and <code>all_admin_notices</code>. Dobby will post an admin notice if any notices have been captured.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dobby.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Frommen said the target audience for his plugin is &#8220;all the people sick and tired of too many admin notifications, which are oftentimes of no real value at all.&#8221; Dobby has a filter available for users to define what &#8220;too many&#8221; means for themselves. The <a href=\"https://github.com/tfrommen/Dobby\" target=\"_blank\">plugin&#8217;s GitHub repository</a> has examples of how to use the Dobby filter threshold, which lets users customize the minimum number of admin notices required to trigger Dobby to start hiding them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It certainly is possible that people may miss (critical) messages with Dobby being active,&#8221; Frommen said. &#8220;However, Dobby is smart enough to style his admin notice according to the most critical one captured. This means that Dobby&#8217;s notice will have error styling if there was an error notice captured. If the most critical one was a warning, thatâ€™s what Dobbyâ€™s notice will be as well. Otherwise, itâ€™s an info notice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Within the first 10 minutes of requesting translations after announcing that Dobby was on WordPress.org, Frommen received German and Dutch translations for the plugin. The plugin UI has only two strings, which makes it a simple, 5-minute translation job.</p>\n<p>Frommen is considering adding a filter for people to define what kind of notices they would like Dobby to capture. He welcomes suggestions, <a href=\"https://github.com/tfrommen/Dobby\" target=\"_blank\">contributions on GitHub</a>, and <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-dobby\" target=\"_blank\">more translations</a> from the WordPress community.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 01 Aug 2017 18:30:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.6.0 Changes Text/Paragraph Block Behavior, Adds New Cover Text and Read More Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73735\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-6-0-changes-textparagraph-block-behavior-adds-new-cover-text-and-read-more-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8239:\"<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/paragraph.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: A Tiny Break From The Rain <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/78814955@N00/34165889514\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f430.png\" alt=\"ðŸ�°\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />Adventures In Wonderland &#038; Through The Looking Glass<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f430.png\" alt=\"ðŸ�°\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/28/whats-new-in-gutenberg-28th-july/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 0.6.0</a> was released over the weekend with significant changes to the way paragraphs are created within text blocks. In previous versions of the plugin, pressing enter would create a line break inside a paragraph. This release modifies the behavior of the text/paragraph block to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1989\" target=\"_blank\">split the block when a user presses enter</a>. (Line breaks can still be created by pressing SHIFT+ENTER.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gutenberg-new-paragraph.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This update is a small improvement in that it hides the text formatting bar when you continue on with a new paragraph, but the slightest scroll or move of the mouse brings it back into view. Contributors are <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1812#issuecomment-314045186\" target=\"_blank\">considering adding a buffer</a> at some point that would only trigger the UI after the mouse moves a certain number of pixels.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the &#8220;New Paragraph&#8221; placeholder text is intrusive and distracting. It is a constant, unwanted reminder of the structure of your document, which is not helpful if you are trying to stay in the flow of writing.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg may improve the experience of vertically stacking differently formatted content, but the writing experience still needs a great deal of work before it can be comparable to what WordPress currently provides. The new editor still gets in the way of writing, instead of silently enabling it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I love Gutenberg so far, but this is too many dongles to display at the moment of focusing on writing. <a href=\"https://t.co/Xpb19KgG01\">pic.twitter.com/Xpb19KgG01</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Daniel Bachhuber (@danielbachhuber) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielbachhuber/status/889944454643064832\">July 25, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>After browsing the Gutenberg repository&#8217;s 400+ issues queue, it&#8217;s clear that contributors are aware of the jarring experience for writers and are working to improve it in every release. However, the beta software is not anywhere near ready for long-form writing, as the intrusive UI places too many cognitive demands on the writer.</p>\n<h3>New Blocks in 0.6.0: &#8220;Cover Text&#8221; and &#8220;Read More&#8221;</h3>\n<p>This release introduces a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2036\" target=\"_blank\">new &#8220;Cover Text&#8221; block</a> that includes background, text color, and full-width options. Color swatches are available in the sidebar block options and contributors are planning to add filters to allow plugin and theme authors to supply a custom palette.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cover-text.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 0.6.0 also includes a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1440\" target=\"_blank\">new &#8220;Read More&#8221; block</a> that inserts a read more link with instant visual feedback within the content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/read-more-block.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also brings several improvements to existing blocks, autosaving for drafts, and initial support for undo/redo keyboard functions.</p>\n<h3>Gutenberg&#8217;s Negative Reviews are Piling Up on WordPress.org</h3>\n<p>Gutenberg contributors are regularly shipping weekly releases, with many features added as bare bones placeholders that will be iterated on in future releases. New blocks are being developed simultaneously with core editing features. Some testers have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-5-0-adds-new-verse-block-for-poetry-and-a-new-display-for-recent-blocks#comment-224944\" target=\"_blank\">bemoaned the proliferation of blocks</a> that may seldom be used while the basic writing experience continues to lag behind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/gutenberg/reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg plugin reviews</a> are currently averaging 2.3 out of 5 stars on WordPress.org, with 46 1-star reviews, 21 5-star reviews, and a handful in between. While the reviews are not a full representation of all who are testing Gutenberg, they provide a small window into users&#8217; current expectations, delights, and frustrations with the editor. Gutenberg contributors are monitoring these forums and using the feedback to create bug reports.</p>\n<p>Many reviewers have left 1-star ratings, begging WordPress to keep it as a plugin instead of adding it to core. One reviewer even took to verse to further elaborate on his one-star review titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/catastophe-how-to-destroy-wordpress-in-2-weeks/\" target=\"_blank\">A Visit from St. Gutenberg</a>&#8221; with an adaptation of the classic poem &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Visit_from_St._Nicholas\" target=\"_blank\">The Night Before Christmas</a>:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nA bundle of blocks he had flung on his back,<br />\nAnd he looked like a coder just opening his pack.</p>\n<p>His eyesâ€”how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!<br />\nâ€œWho needs MCE, when we have blocks and so many?â€�</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many reviewers find Gutenberg to be &#8220;unnecessarily complex&#8221; for actions that were previously easy to perform in the editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have several websites &#8211; two are for business and include blogs (technical posts, how-tos, etc),&#8221; @quantaweb <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/please-make-it-a-plugin-not-part-of-core/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;Iâ€™m also the editor of a literary magazine. This doesnâ€™t work for any of these sites. Itâ€™s not easier to write blogs with it, and it does nothing to ease the work of importing critical essays and poetry into the literary magazine â€” and formatting them â€” either&#8230;Gutenberg is unnecessarily complex.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some of the 1-star reviews come laced with threats to move to another CMS and splinter the WordPress community if Gutenberg is included in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By removing all the traditional editor buttons and trying to make a minimalist design the usefulness and ease of use has been drastically reduced,&#8221; @ovann86 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-example-of-why-developers-are-not-ux-experts/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;I found myself either not being able to do very basic content management or having to click, hover and look for the buttons â€“ instead of them being visible and available immediately&#8230;If this was made core I would likely be forced to move to another CMS.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Early testing of beta software is not for everyone, as many are unable to look past the initial bugs and clunky implementations to see the potential of the editor to improve WordPress&#8217; severely fragmented content creation experience. Matt Mullenweg jumped onto the forums as recently as two weeks ago to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/not-ready-for-prime-time-14/#post-9316327\" target=\"_blank\">respond to testers&#8217; feedback</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We definitely agree itâ€™s not ready for prime time yet, thatâ€™s why weâ€™re doing extensive public testing and iteration while itâ€™s in the plugin phase,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Thank you for your feedback and I hope you try it again in a few months with an open mind.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 31 Jul 2017

at WordCamp Europe I had the opportunity to meet Russian designer and developer <a href=\"https://dmtrmrv.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dmitry Mayorov</a>, whose themes I had noticed earlier in the year in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/iamdmitrymayorov/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Theme Directory</a>. Mayorov&#8217;s design style is reminiscent of other niche theme developers like Anders NorÃ©n and Mike McAlister. He launched his own commercial themes business on <a href=\"https://themepatio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ThemePatio.com</a> two years ago and his free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/counter/\" target=\"_blank\">Counter</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/maker/\" target=\"_blank\">Maker</a> themes collectively have more than 3,000 active installs on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/counter.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/maker.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n<p>Mayorov started taking part in meetups in Russia in 2013. Following WordCamp Moscow 2015, Konstantin Kovshenin asked him if he would take on the role of lead organizer. Mayorov is organizing <a href=\"https://2017.moscow.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Moscow 2017</a>, which is scheduled for August 12. In our interview below, he describes a few of the challenges organizers face in uniting the Russian WordPress community that is spread out over such a large land mass.</p>\n<p>Mayorov also discusses how he began creating WordPress themes and how clients&#8217; needs influenced his <a href=\"https://themepatio.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">theme development philosophy</a>. He aspires to create themes that are fast, content-focused, and minimalistic, without the bloat of hundreds of font options and pre-built site layouts. Mayorov also gave us his predictions for the future of the theme industry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to go two directions at the same time,&#8221; Mayorov said. &#8220;I think that page builders and multi-purpose themes wont go anywhere but I also think that niche themes are here to stay as well. Not everybody is looking for a page builder.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I see the tendency that at first when people get introduced to WordPress they discover theme marketplaces. They think, &#8216;Ok this is the top seller, I&#8217;m going to go with this theme.&#8217; For some people it works, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, because sometimes you have challenges where you need to create a website like yesterday&#8230;Once they see that there is another way, they start to research other theme developers and shops, realizing that there are simple themes that work faster and are easier to use, and that you don&#8217;t need to spend two hours trying to create the homepage. They will use those themes as well. These are the themes I&#8217;m trying to build.&#8221;</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 19:57:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Customize Snapshots 0.6.0 Adds the Ability to Name and Merge Changesets\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73700\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/customize-snapshots-0-6-0-adds-the-ability-to-name-and-merge-changesets\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5042:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/snapshots.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/T80PGTWXHZ\">Freestocks.org</a>\n<p>Contributors to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-snapshots/\" target=\"_blank\">Customize Snapshots</a> feature plugin are steadily building a UI for managing Customizer changesets using the changesets infrastructure added in WordPress 4.7. <a href=\"https://make.xwp.co/2017/07/27/customize-snapshots-0-6-release/\" target=\"_blank\">Version 0.6.0</a> of the plugin was released this month with an expanded interface for managing the complexities of multi-user editing in the Customizer.</p>\n<p>The previous version of Customize Snapshots already supported scheduling but this release introduces a new multi-select save button that allows users to publish, save draft, save as pending, or schedule changes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/customize-snapshots-multi-select-button.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 0.6.0 adds the ability to name changesets, which is especially helpful for site owners who are sorting and previewing changes submitted by multiple editors. The list of changesets has links for previewing on the frontend, editing in the Customizer, or inspecting the changeset&#8217;s content on the edit post screen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/saved-changesets.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release introduces the ability to merge multiple changesets into a single changeset, which users can then preview and publish all at once.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/merge-changesets.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Contributors have not yet worked out how this feature will handle conflicting changes submitted by multiple users. It currently accepts whatever change was made more recently, but this isn&#8217;t ideal in certain situations. <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20conflict\" target=\"_blank\">Conflict resolution</a> is on the team&#8217;s radar to address in future iterations of the plugin and they are discussing several different approaches.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Merging changesets would definitely lie in the realm of a power user feature,&#8221; Customize component co-maintainer Weston Ruter said. &#8220;It would probably not be proposed for core. Nevertheless, the existence of the feature is a demonstration of the kinds of things that can be possible when working with changesets.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to co-leading WordPress&#8217; Customizer team, Ruter is also the CTO at XWP, where several of the agency&#8217;s clients are actively using the Customize Snapshots plugin. News Corp Australia and Beachbody are two companies that have invested in the plugin&#8217;s development and are successfully using it at scale on their network of sites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When paired with the Customize Posts plugin, it gets really powerful because you can edit multiple posts and pages, along with any of their postmeta, while also editing widgets, nav menus, and any other settings, and all of these changes are all bundled together in a single changeset,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;This changeset can then be previewed on the frontend, including by sharing the URL with an unauthenticated user (like a 3rd party who can&#8217;t even access the Customizer), and they can click around the site with all of the customizations applied as if they had been published.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ruter said the Customizer team isn&#8217;t currently targeting a WordPress release for getting these new UI additions added to core but rather view the progress as &#8220;prototypes for what could be merged into core, bit by bit.&#8221; He identified several tickets that the plugin provides prototype interfaces for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28721\" target=\"_blank\">#28721</a>: Scheduled changes for the customizer</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31089\" target=\"_blank\">#31089</a>: Add revisions and statuses for changesets</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21666\" target=\"_blank\">#21666</a>: Customizer reset/undo/revert</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896\" target=\"_blank\">#39896</a>: Customizer: Allow users to Draft changes before Publishing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;Core development is still very much focused on the editor â€” Gutenberg â€” so the far-reaching Customizer changes are not being emphasized yet,&#8221; Ruter said. Meanwhile progress continues on the Customize Snapshots plugin, which was completely rewritten for the 0.6.0 release after most of its infrastructure was merged into WordPress 4.7. Ruter&#8217;s team is not sure which features will eventually land in core, but the various Customizer feature plugins give users an idea of the power of the changesets infrastructure that is already included in WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 22:58:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: .blog Passes 100,000 Registrations, 66.5% of Purchased Domains are in Use\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73673\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/blog-passes-100000-registrations-66-5-of-purchased-domains-are-in-use\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5302:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The .blog domain extension, managed by Automattic subsidiary Knock Knock WHOIS There (KKWT), opened registration to the public in November 2016 and has just <a href=\"https://my.blog/2017/07/26/100000-blogs/\" target=\"_blank\">passed the 100,000 registration milestone</a>. The extension is averaging 300 new .blog domains registered per day and is quickly gaining popularity among new generic TLDs. According to the most recent stats available at nTLDStats, <a href=\"https://ntldstats.com/tld/blog\" target=\"_blank\">.blog registrations</a> have climbed steadily and predictably every month since its public launch.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog-registrations.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>.blog registrations according to ntldstats.com\n<p>Automattic, which operates independently from KKWT as a registrar, currently has the largest market share of .blog domain registrars at 62.8%. Other smaller pieces of the pie continue to see increasing numbers of registrations. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/registrar-market-share-blog.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;When a .blog domain is sold through any .blog registrar, it operates like all other top-level domains (TLDs),&#8221; .blog representative Erica Varlese said. &#8220;This means that the registry, in this case Knock Knock WHOIS There, receives the wholesale cost, ICANN receives their fees, and the registrar retains the rest.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The .blog team has started experimenting with different marketing programs to promote the extension among registrars and launched its first campaigns last month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These programs are available to any .blog accredited registrar and, through participation, allows them to provide .blog domains to their customers at a discounted rate,&#8221; Varlese said. &#8220;It is designed to test price elasticity and various end-user marketing techniques that best fit each registrars&#8217; unique customer-base.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Registration for .blog domains is fully integrated into WordPress.com&#8217;s domain offerings, but Varlese said that Knock Knock WHOIS There, as a separate company, is not informed of the specific details of their domain roadmap. The subsidiary also does not track how many of the .blog domains are running WordPress, as the extension is platform agnostic and in use across many different blogging services. </p>\n<p>So far .blog domain customers include both individuals and businesses, including some e-commerce and community sites. Varlese said the main benefit to acquiring a .blog domain is that customers are more likely to get and use a name they always wanted (example.blog), versus settling for a more complicated variation, such as blog.example.com.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Using a blog domain is also a great way to embrace engagement with your community,&#8221; Varlese said. &#8220;In addition to individual and personal bloggers, we also see larger brands using blogs to engage with their customers. Visiting <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.blog\" target=\"_blank\">stackoverflow.blog</a>, for example, is intuitive. The domain lets me know right away what type of content and interaction to expect versus what my expectations would be when prompted to visit stackoverflow.com. Both are equally important and both add value to the customerâ€™s online experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many people purchase a domain just to sit on it for the right time to use it or sell. Greater usage of .blog domains promotes visibility on the web, which is why registrars place value on how many have launched websites using the extension. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Our goal is steady, long-term growth while continuing to increase our usage rates,&#8221; Varlese said. &#8220;We want every .blog domain to resolve to a unique content site or blog. Usage is an important metric for us. It positively contributes to help the new TLD marketplace thrive and grow organically. It is at the forefront of every decision we make, including marketing and rebate programs for our registrars, as well as our dotblogger program, which gives online influencers easy access to all .blog domains, including premium and reserved domains.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The .blog team&#8217;s 100,000 registrations milestone post cites usage stats from Pandalytics, a domains data service, that are not publicly available. </p>\n<p>&#8220;66.5% of .blog domains have a unique website associated with them, compared to an average of 39.3% for both new and legacy TLDs, according to recent research by Daniel Ruzzini-Mejia (co-founder and CSO of DomainsBot Srl, the company behind big-data analysis platform Pandalytics),&#8221; Varlese said. &#8220;Ruzzini-Mejia also found more than 250 .blog domains that use an eCommerce platform.&#8221; </p>\n<p>This is an interesting find in an era where many have claimed that blogs are dead. If the indie web proponents have their way, blogs may have another renaissance yet, and could become the anchors of commerce and identity online. The healthy usage numbers the .blog extension has posted in its first year are a strong indicator that the concept of blogging still holds an important place on the web. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 18:09:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: Adobe to Discontinue Flash Support and Updates in 2020\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73654\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://wptavern.com/adobe-to-discontinue-flash-support-and-updates-in-2020\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3545:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/adobe-flash.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Adobe <a href=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2017/07/adobe-flash-update.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> today that it will discontinue Flash support and updates at the end of 2020. Flash played an important part in the history of the web, inspiring many of the open standards and formats that the web has moved on to embrace.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Given this progress, and in collaboration with several of our technology partners â€“ including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla â€“ Adobe is planning to end-of-life Flash. Specifically, we will stop updating and distributing the Flash Player at the end of 2020 and encourage content creators to migrate any existing Flash content to these new open formats.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Last year most major browsers moved to block Flash, requiring users to enable it manually for sites where they wish to view Flash content. Microsoft, Google, and Mozilla were on deck today with announcements of their own regarding future Flash support. Firefox is the most aggressive with its <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2017/07/25/firefox-roadmap-flash-end-life/\" target=\"_blank\">plan to disable Flash for most users in 2019</a>. Only those running an Extended Support Release will be able to continue using it through the end of 2020 and no version of Firefox will load the plugin after Adobe discontinues security patches.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/saying-goodbye-flash-chrome/\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome is also phasing out support for Flash</a> and plans to remove it completely from the browser toward the end of 2020.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Three years ago, 80 percent of desktop Chrome users visited a site with Flash each day,&#8221; Google Chrome Product Manager Anthony Laforge said. &#8220;Today usage is only 17 percent and continues to decline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This trend reveals that sites are migrating to open web technologies, which are faster and more power-efficient than Flash. Theyâ€™re also more secure, so you can be safer while shopping, banking, or reading sensitive documents.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Microsoft Edge team also <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/07/25/flash-on-windows-timeline/#QKXFIeE23ZSoZLlh.97\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> its plans to phase out Flash from both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer with complete removal from all supported versions of Microsoft Windows by the end of 2020.</p>\n<p>Although <a href=\"http://blog.kongregate.com/html5-is-here/\" target=\"_blank\">HTML5 adoption is growing among game developers</a>, Adobe&#8217;s announcement means major changes for segments of the the gaming, education, and video industries that have not yet migrated to newer, open formats. This news will also make obsolete dozens of WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/flash/\" target=\"_blank\">plugins that were created to upload and display Flash content</a>.</p>\n<p>Adobe&#8217;s announcement was met with thanks and &#8220;good riddance,&#8221; with many calling for an even speedier timeline. Many are also concerned about all the orphaned content and .swf games on the web that Flash&#8217;s disappearance will create. Adobe has received many requests on Twitter for the company to consider open sourcing the old Flash Player codebase for the sake of compatibility and archiving content. Adobe has not officially replied to any of these requests.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 04:01:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"HeroPress: Random Diary Chapters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1992\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"https://heropress.com/essays/random-diary-chapters/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=random-diary-chapters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7835:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/072617-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: WordPress combines people together from all over the world. Maybe WordPress is important after all.\" /><blockquote><p>There goes my hero<br />\nWatch him as he goes<br />\nThere goes my hero<br />\nHe&#8217;s ordinary</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"></div>\n<p>I have no idea what Iâ€™m going to write about. How about people? Ordinary people are heroes to me. People who are willing to help one another. People just like you and me.</p>\n<p>Well, at least like you <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> &#8211; if youâ€™re for some reason reading my diary.</p>\n<h2>Whoâ€™s teaching who</h2>\n<p>I still remember when I build my first website with table layouts while studying math in the University of JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤. Those were the days! But it doesnâ€™t feel like yesterday anymore. More like day before.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless being a math teacher has been the perfect choice for me. Itâ€™s been fun, challenging, and rewarding. Iâ€™ve probably learnt lot more from students than they have from me.</p>\n<p>Heck, they even got me into WordPress when I was taking my ex-students short film course. Was it 2008? Something like that. We needed a website for our short film and had only 1-2 days. Students gave me link to WordPress.com and I was sold. Getting site up and running was easy and fast.</p>\n<p>â€œWell come here and do it yourself!!â€� &#8211; drama class student shouted.</p>\n<p>Thatâ€™s another good lesson Iâ€™ve learnt.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Itâ€™s so easy to give negative feedback (donâ€™t do it like that) without doing anything yourself or giving constructive feedback.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oh boy I still feel ashamed when I judged a book by itâ€™s cover. This time the book cover was a blonde girl asking weird questions with high voice. I was a prison of my prejudice and instantly assumed she must be bad at math. How wrong was I. She was brilliant.</p>\n<p>At least the prison gate is now open if I just understand to walk out.</p>\n<h2>Who am I</h2>\n<p>Sometimes I wonder what other people think of me? Do they think Iâ€™m open minded teacher, or front-developer who cares about accessibility. But does any of that matter? Job title really doesnâ€™t tell anything who I am. Or anybody else.</p>\n<p>But who am I? Iâ€™m not sure how to define me. Iâ€™m no dad or husband. I do have several good traits but there are also demons inside me. Lack of empathy is one of them. And that comes down to this:</p>\n<p>In the end <strong>Iâ€™m a selfish asshole</strong>.</p>\n<p>Itâ€™s okay to be selfish from time to time but itâ€™s not okay to let people down big time when they need me most. Being an ordinary human being is not one of my strengths but Iâ€™ll promise to work on it.</p>\n<h2>Friends will be friends</h2>\n<p>I consider myself lucky. I have lovely parents and two crazy big brothers. And over the years I have made friendships that last forever.</p>\n<p>I hope everybody have a friend who is like a bridge between other friends. Someone who is always organizing something fun: bowling, music gigs, dinners, sports. Someone who is always nice to others and would never hurt a fly.</p>\n<p>I had a friend like that.</p>\n<p>But as a return I couldnâ€™t help him enough. Shadows of life had taken over him. He could not see the light anymore. He died by suicide before christmas 2015.</p>\n<p>Now he canâ€™t fall anymore. He will always be our beloved one and weâ€™ll miss him more than words can express. So many songs reflects to memories we have. For example this Finnish song that I heard exactly one year after his death. (<a href=\"http://lyricstranslate.com/en/rakastettu-beloved.html\">Lyrics in english</a>).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"></div>\n<p>Why is it so much easier to talk about other problems but not your own. Why is it so hard to ask help when you really need it.</p>\n<h2>Life goes on</h2>\n<p>Do I need to say anything. No I don&#8217;t.</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/summer-of-2017-peaceful-mind-after-sauna.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1995\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/summer-of-2017-peaceful-mind-after-sauna.jpg\" alt=\"View of the water form the shore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" /></a>Summer 2017.

People behind it are, they have feelings. I wish more people would remember that when commenting on blog posts, Slack, or other online tools with shitty attitudes.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Being nice and constructive goes a long way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>AtÂ the same time itâ€™s amazing to notice how WordPress combines people together from all over the world. In WordCamps and meetups I have found new friends that really matter. That feels good.</p>\n<p>Maybe WordPress is important after all.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Random Diary Chapters\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Random%20Diary%20Chapters&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Frandom-diary-chapters%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Random Diary Chapters\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Frandom-diary-chapters%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Frandom-diary-chapters%2F&title=Random+Diary+Chapters\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Random Diary Chapters\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/random-diary-chapters/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/072617-150x150.jpg&description=Random Diary Chapters\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Random Diary Chapters\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/random-diary-chapters/\" title=\"Random Diary Chapters\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/random-diary-chapters/\">Random Diary Chapters</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 00:00:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sami Keijonen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:138:\"WPTavern: SiteLock Acquires Patchmanâ€™s Malware and Vulnerability Detection Technology, Expands WordPress Customer Base to 4 Million\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73626\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:140:\"https://wptavern.com/sitelock-acquires-patchmans-malware-and-vulnerability-detection-technology-expands-wordpress-customer-base-to-4-million\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4490:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sitelock-logo.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sitelock.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SiteLock</a>, a website security company, has <a href=\"https://www.sitelock.com/pr/extends-web-security-leadership-patchman-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\">acquired</a> <a href=\"http://patchman.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Patchman</a>, a Dutch security startup that offers automated vulnerability patching and malware removal for hosting providers. Prior to the acquisition SiteLock protected 6 million sites, with 2.2 million of them running on WordPress. The addition of Patchman extends SiteLock&#8217;s customer base to 12 million sites and more than 4 million of those are powered by WordPress.</p>\n<p>Patchman detects vulnerabilities in <a href=\"https://patchman.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200236661-Which-applications-does-Patchman-scan-and-fix-\" target=\"_blank\">a wide range of popular applications</a> and quarantines and patches threats automatically. The quarantine feature neutralizes malicious files by removing them from public access. Patchman supports detection and patching for WordPress 3.x and later.</p>\n<p>Historically, the service has not included patches for plugins but it has applied them on a case-by-case basis for high impact vulnerabilities, including a few found in WP Super Cache, MailPoet, and the open source Genericons font project. The Patchman dashboard allows users to easily track files where vulnerabilities have been detected, view status, and revert patches if necessary.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/patchman-dashboard.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Patchman&#8217;s single focus on hosting providers gives SiteLock the opportunity to offer more options to its hosting partners. With the acquisition, the company is now partering with more than 500 hosting providers, including BlueHost, 1&amp;1, Web.com, InMotion, Melbourne IT, GMO (NTT), and many others.</p>\n<p>&#8220;During our early talks, Patchman was not looking to be acquired and SiteLock wasnâ€™t looking to acquire,&#8221; SiteLock President Neill Feather said. After meeting at the WorldHostingDays show in Rust, Germany in late March this year and at another show in Los Angeles, the companies found they shared similar goals and would be in a better position working together.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It truly was a matter of 1+1=3,&#8221; Feather said. &#8220;Traditionally, SiteLock is very strong in detecting and removing malware for end users. Patchman offers a service tailored specifically to hosting providers and aimed at fixing the security vulnerabilities that hackers exploit to infect websites with malware. By working together we are able to address a wider market and offer a broader solution to the problems that we solve for our customers. We can now attack the problem from multiple angles.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Patchman&#8217;s technology will compliment SiteLock&#8217;s existing security features but the company has not yet decided how it will be incorporated into its security plans for customers. Feather said the team is still jointly building out its future roadmap to give hosts and end customers access to a wider range of products. They are also considering making Patchman&#8217;s detection technology compatible with more products in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Feather could not disclose any specifics on revenue generated by <a href=\"https://wpdistrict.sitelock.com/products/\" target=\"_blank\">SiteLock&#8217;s WordPress security products</a> but approximately 30% of its newly expanded customer base is running on WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What we can say is that weâ€™re heavily invested in the WordPress community and plan on continuing to do so,&#8221; Feather said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited that the increased number of sites we now protect across multiple platforms means we&#8217;ll be able to identify malware and malicious trends more efficiently than we&#8217;ve been able to already, and that&#8217;s good for every end user,&#8221; SiteLock&#8217;s WordPress Evangelist Adam Warner said. &#8220;Secondly, although we already have solutions for our partners, Patchman allows web hosts to offer increased security options for advanced users of their platforms. Being a WordPress guy, I&#8217;m excited about the possibility we now have to extend the capabilities of Patchman to plugins and other WordPress-specific software.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 18:46:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: Watch WordCamp Varna Wapuus Get Designed in Real Time\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=73617\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wptavern.com/watch-wordcamp-varna-wapuus-get-designed-in-real-time\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1390:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/wordcamp-varna-wapuus.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The very first <a href=\"https://2017.varna.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Varna</a> will be held September 2-3 at the <a href=\"https://www.ue-varna.bg/en/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Economics</a>.

The appearance of the new editor, codenamed â€œAztec,&#8221; is very similar to the old one but is light years ahead of its predecessor in both speed and reliability. Aaron Douglas, iOS engineer at Automattic, announced the <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/07/24/a-brand-new-editor-for-the-wordpress-mobile-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">open beta for Aztec</a> today with a side-by-side comparison video of the old and new editors. A copy and paste test with 500 paragraphs on iPhone 6s demonstrates Aztec&#8217;s instantaneous response while the old editor takes two-minutes to render the text.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition to better speed and performance, Aztec&#8217;s use of OS-provided text controls makes it possible to offer full support for accessibility technologies like iOSâ€™ VoiceOver and Androidâ€™s TalkBack. It also adds the ability to draft using dictation.</p>\n<p>Aztec introduces a new undo/redo tool at the top of the screen as a quick option for fixing mistakes. It also provides a simpler, more reliable experience using spell check.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/aztec-testing.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Aztec beta is available to all users in the latest updates of the app (8.0 for iOS, 7.8 for Android). After opening the app you will see a popup for enabling the new editor. It can also be toggled on/off by going to Me > App Settings and selecting &#8220;Set the Editor Type.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The mobile team has made it easy to test and give feedback without leaving the app. Tapping the &#8220;beta&#8221; button at the top of the editor will open a &#8220;What&#8217;s New in the Beta&#8221; page with a bug button at the top that you can use to report bugs and send feedback. At the moment, the beta does not support shortcodes or video and WordPress gallery features. Keep in mind that it&#8217;s not 100% ready for use and heavy users of the mobile apps are likely to discover glitches.</p>\n<p>Aztec is open source (GPL 2.0) and packaged as a rich-text editor component in its own GitHub repository (<a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Aztec-iOS\" target=\"_blank\">iOS</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Aztec-Android\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>) so that developers can use it in their own applications and contribute code back to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Quite literally, there is nothing like this out there â€“ every editor we could find uses a web view or has very limited support for any HTML,&#8221; Douglas said. &#8220;Our hope is the Aztec editor is seen as a component that can be used by many iOS and Android apps to provide a rich HTML editing experience. We feel that we could garner a bigger contributor base to the mobile apps simply because this component exists, is free and open, and is super awesome.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The project is a few months behind the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2017/04/08/introducing-the-aztec-mobile-editors/\" target=\"_blank\">schedule published in April</a>, which had open beta targeted for May and the full release for the end of this month. Depending on how well the beta testing period goes, users could see the new Aztec editor included in the mobile apps within the next few months.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 22:59:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"WPTavern: Hamilton: A Free WordPress Portfolio Theme for Photographers, Illustrators, and Designers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=72881\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/hamilton-a-free-wordpress-portfolio-theme-for-photographers-illustrators-and-designers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3787:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/hamilton/\" target=\"_blank\">Hamilton</a> is a new portfolio theme released by Swedish designer and developer <a href=\"http://www.andersnoren.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Anders NorÃ©n</a> during his summer vacation. It was created for photographers, illustrators, designers, and image-heavy blogs. The theme displays portfolio items in a minimal, masonry-style grid with an optional tagline on the front page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-white-black-1.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Hamilton has a pretty simple design at its core, so when it was more or less finished, I decided to add a couple of fun theme options to make it more customizable,&#8221; NorÃ©n said. &#8220;The main one is the Dark Mode. With a click of the mouse in the WordPress Customizer, you can change Hamilton from dark text on a white background to white text on a dark background.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Customizer also includes a few other helpful options for portfolio sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set a custom background image or color</li>\n<li>Replace the navigation toggle in the header with the Primary Menu on desktop</li>\n<li>Change two-column default post grid display to three columns on desktop</li>\n<li>Display titles in the post previews</li>\n<li>Add a title to front page when it&#8217;s set to display latest posts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The theme is beautifully responsive to various devices and screen sizes.

It gives users the option to add a simple resume to their portfolios, without having to add a plugin. The template uses basic HTML for formatting with h1 header tags, horizontal rules, and unordered lists. The template could use a bit more documentation, since not all users are familiar with HTML, but it&#8217;s a useful addition for simple portfolio sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/resume-template.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Check out a <a href=\"http://andersnoren.se/themes/hamilton/\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> along with the <a href=\"http://andersnoren.se/themes/hamilton/style-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">style guide</a> to see the theme in action.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/hamilton/\" target=\"_blank\">Hamilton</a> is Anders NorÃ©n&#8217;s 15th theme approved for the WordPress Theme Directory.

Over the course of a few months he started going deeper into learning about writing WordPress plugins and produced <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/\" target=\"_blank\">Members</a>, a role management plugin for WordPress. The first major overhaul of the plugin came in 2015 with version 1.0&#8217;s expansion of features and a new UI for editing roles.</p>\n<p>Members has built up a user base of more than 100,000 active installs since it first <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/09/17/members-wordpress-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">launched in 2009</a>. Tadlock estimates that over the last couple years, 40% of <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Hybrid</a> customers are primarily there for support and small tweaks to the Members plugin. He decided it was time to begin investing more in the plugin and its community.</p>\n<p>Tadlock released <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/weblog/members-version-2-0\" target=\"_blank\">Members 2.0</a> this week. The plugin manages core WordPress capabilities but 2.0 adds the ability for plugins to register custom capabilities. The labels for the capabilities can be internationalized so users can manage the plugin in their own languages in human-readable form.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-human-caps.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also adds the ability to use the WordPress editor for writing custom post error messages, making it easy to direct visitors to registration or other important information regarding access to the content.</p>\n<p>Members 2.0 lets users add multiple roles when creating a new user from the Add User screen. It also introduces the ability to bulk add or remove roles from users, even when multiple roles have been enabled.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-bulk-users.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This version of the plugin serves some of its data using the WP REST API and a new setting was added to authenticate users who are accessing the REST API endpoints. This protects content from being exposed on sites that have the &#8220;private site&#8221; setting enabled. Tadlock plans to write a tutorial about what he has learned in integrating the REST API with the plugin.</p>\n<h3>Tadlock Aims to Monetize Members with Add-Ons, Renews Efforts to Develop a Community of Add-On Developers</h3>\n<p>Members 2.0 introduces a new Settings screen that ties in with Tadlock&#8217;s future plans to monetize the plugin. The new screen includes a view for add-ons. Tadlock has two add-ons available currently and has written an API for third-party developers to register their own add-ons to be visible on this screen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-addons.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The plan is to create some small add-on plugins,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;There&#8217;s already two:  <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members-role-levels\" target=\"_blank\">Members &#8211; Role Levels</a>, which is paid, and <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members-role-hierarchy\" target=\"_blank\">Members &#8211; Role Hierarchy</a>, which I was hired to build and was allowed to release to the community for free. I&#8217;ve got a few small plugins like those in mind that&#8217;ll be in a lower price range.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock also plans to release a more robust version of the &#8220;Content Permissions&#8221; feature as another add-on. He has received numerous feature requests from users over the years about what they would like to see in this plugin. The add-on will offer a variety of different ways to show/hide content.</p>\n<p>I asked Tadlock if he has considered building payment gateway add-ons so users can charge for memberships. He said the idea is on the table.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m going to build those or someone else,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve mentioned it to some other developers. It would be a good place to start building add-ons.&#8221; His current setup uses Easy Digital Downloads with a couple of plugins to bridge it with Members and ThemeHybrid.com.</p>\n<p>A plugin like Members has the potential to have a large, third-party ecosystem of plugins for payments and additional features, but Tadlock was focused on other projects during the first few years after it launched.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t actively pursued the add-on angle,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Instead, I focused more on themes during most of that time. Now, I&#8217;m focusing more on plugin development. It&#8217;s my fault for not nurturing a community of add-on developers, which is something I&#8217;m trying to do more of now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock said many of the developers he knows are working with Members because they like that it gives them a solid foundation to build on for client work. He hopes to persuade some of them to release some of that code back as commercial add-ons or free plugins in the WordPress plugin directory.</p>\n<p>Since launching the plugin eight years ago, Tadlock has aimed to make it behave as if it were a natural part of WordPress. At its core, Members is a role and capability management plugin and not a one-size-fits all membership plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more or less a UI over what you could do with code already,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Most of all, it tries not to get in your way. Every membership site has its own unique needs. It&#8217;s tough building something that suits everyone.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;d rather have that foundation of Members just exposing the roles/caps system with third-party add-ons that suit various users&#8217; needs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other membership plugins often try to please everyone or pigeon-hole everything into their custom system.

Unfortunately, this <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-disable-visual-editor-in-the-text-widget/\">caused issues</a> for those who use Custom HTML as the Visual editor often strips out portions of the code.</p>\n<p>WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/#beta-and-rc\">4.8.1 Beta 1</a> is available for testing and addresses this problem by including a dedicated Custom HTML widget.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For advanced users or any user who needs to paste in HTML snippets, there is now a dedicated &#8216;Custom HTML&#8217; widget that is specifically for adding arbitrary HTML to your sidebar,&#8221; Weston Ruter, said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This widget will retain the application of the <code>widget_text</code> filters, in addition to having a new dedicated <code>widget_custom_html_content</code> filter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For use cases that involve adding content to your sidebar, the Text widget will continue to feature the same Visual editing interface that the post editor has (TinyMCE).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Users who access Text widgets that have Custom HTML in WordPress 4.8.1, will see a note at the top of the widget that suggests using the Custom HTML widget.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>If a user pastes or types HTML into a text widget with the Visual editor active, WordPress displays an Admin Pointer suggesting that they use the Text tab instead or use the Custom HTML widget.</p>\n<img />Text Widget Admin Pointer\n<p>The Custom HTML widget works similar to the Text widget in WordPress 4.7 and below.</p>\n<img />Custom HTML Widget\n<p>Sites that have existing Text widgets containing custom HTML that may be modified by the Visual editor, are opened in a legacy mode.</p>\n<p>Legacy mode retains the old Text widget interface, including the checkbox on whether or not to automatically add paragraphs. This change prevents the Visual editor from altering code.</p>\n<p>Ruter says the ideal way to test these improvements is to install it on a staging site that has Text widgets containing HTML and are known to be problematic in WordPress 4.8.Â After upgrading, check to see if the widgets open in legacy mode.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.8.1 is scheduled to be released on August 1st.

So far the GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191\" target=\"_blank\">issue</a> has received 627 &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; emoji and 66 comments from concerned React users who are hoping for a change in licensing.</p>\n<p>Many respondents on the thread said that ASF&#8217;s decision affects their organizations&#8217; ability to continue using React in projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Apache CouchDB and others will switch away from React if we have to,&#8221; CouchDB committer Robert Newson <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-315596902\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d rather not, it&#8217;s a lot of work for no real gain, but we don&#8217;t have a choice. Changing license can be simple (RocksDB completed that change in a day).&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;My team, at LinkedIn, is also having legal troubles using React for our internal projects,&#8221; LinkedIn software Denis Ivanov <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316500996\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;We would love to see a change on this front.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Software developer Clark Evans <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-315607798\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on how React&#8217;s current licensing might affect medical research institutes, and suggested that Facebook consider an Apache 2.0 license because it includes equitable patent grants.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Since U.S. based universities rely upon patent licensing as part of their legislatively mandated technology transfer initiatives, they are growing far more cautious in their due diligence. For this reason, at some universities, software written with React may be shunned. Existing projects using React software may be asked to remove the React software software dependency. Please strongly consider this proposal, since our RexDB work is used at major universities, we do not wish to rework to use a React alternative.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Several participants in the discussion commented that they would like to use React but the licensing makes it impossible for their companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other large companies such as mine (Adobe) can&#8217;t use React, Pop, etc. for the very same reason,&#8221; Corey Lucier <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316046522\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d love to participate in the project, contribute to each, etc. but Facebook&#8217;s heavy-handed PATENTS clause is a showstopper.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even mid-size companies like mine (ViaSat) are starting to disallow the use of Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;open-source&#8217; projects for this reason,&#8221; software developer Aaron Yoshitake <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316102045\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d like to build React web and native apps, but it seems that any sensible legal department will recommend against agreeing to Facebook&#8217;s asymmetric patent grant.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Internal Discussions Continue at Facebook, Re-Licensing Issue has been Escalated to Engineering Directors</h3>\n<p>Dan Abramov, co-author of Redux, Create React App, and React Hot Loader, shared with participants that Facebook is having internal discussions about the re-licensing issue but cautioned them to temper their optimism. He returned to throw some ice on the conversation, which has grown more heated over the past few days, when he said it could only remain an open discussion if everyone involved remains civil. Many participants are concerned about the future of the React-based software that they have already invested thousands of hours of work into.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand that everyone is frustrated about this issue,&#8221; Abramov <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316223034\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;Personally I am just as frustrated to spend time, energy, and emotional wellbeing on legal mumbo jumbo that is preventing people from using React. I would much prefer to spend this time on working together to make it better.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But the reality of this situation is that the maintainers of React (people like me that youâ€™re interacting on the issue tracker) are not the ones making these decisions. Each of us is doing what we can to show different perspectives on this issue to the people who can make those decisions, and we appreciate your feedback too. But we can only keep discussion open if everyone stays civil and respectful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Abramov also pointed out in a follow-up update that a bug tracker isn&#8217;t the best avenue for a legal discussion, especially since most participants are software developers and not lawyers. Many have mistaken the thread as a way to communicate with Facebook but there are just a handful of software developers who are representing the React community&#8217;s concerns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have heard you very well, and we have passed on your concerns,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;But repeating the same points over and over in different threads does not help move this forward, and creates a lot of noise and stress for the maintainers who are already empathetic to your cause.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several participants expressed frustration that the React community cannot participate in the discussions more directly. However, as React is both an open source project and a product of Facebook, the company&#8217;s leadership has the last word on licensing issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand that software developers like us are not the best people to discuss legal details,&#8221; software consultant Erik Doernenburg <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316318170\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;However, wouldn&#8217;t the logical consequence be that the Facebook Legal team, who make such decisions, become active in this forum? Shouldn&#8217;t it be possible that all relevant details pertaining to a piece of open source software are discussed in the open? It is incredibly frustrating to have such an important aspect of open software discussed behind closed doors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not known whether Facebook is considering another change to its Patents grant or a complete re-licensing. Participants in the discussion are also concerned about other Facebook open source projects like GraphQL, Relay, React Native, and Flow, which share the same BSD+Patents License and are widely used by the open source community.</p>\n<p>Dan Abramov left an <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316739812\" target=\"_blank\">update</a> today to let the community know that no resolution is available this week. However, the update seemed more positive than the first one, which discouraged participants from being optimistic about a change.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to point out that there is a real momentum behind this discussion internally,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;There are going to be more meetings next week escalating this up to the engineering directors. As you imagine they are quite busy, so this is taking more time than we thought.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Again, I canâ€™t promise you any specific conclusion, and there is no clarity on where this will land. But please know there are people working on getting your voice heard.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 22:37:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 282 â€“ Talking WooCommerce with Cody Landefeld\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=73448&preview=true&preview_id=73448\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-282-talking-woocommerce-with-cody-landefield\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3386:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me/\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/codyL\">Cody Landefeld</a>, Senior web strategist and founder of <a href=\"https://modeeffect.com/\">Mode Effect</a>.

The education centres provided access to 156,860 (accumulated data until 31 December 2016) hardest to reach children who otherwise would not have access to any education. Todate, 7,428 pupils successfully completed Primary Education Completion Examination (PECE) and the number of PECE graduates is estimated to increase to 10,250 at the project closure.\r\n\r\nCurrently Aloghar operates 304 schools which are fully dedicated to the education of about 15,500 adivasi/ethnic children across the country. 391 education centres comprise mixed students from ethnic and Bengali communities.  At the earlier grades i.e. pre- school to grade 2 the adivasi/ethnic children receive lessons in their mother language by teachers who also speak the same language. Aloghar produced textbooks in 8 Adivasi languages for use in its mother language based classes. On completion of the early grades the ethnic children are usually inducted into the mainstream education – government primary school (GPS) or mission schools supported by the churches.\r\n\r\nThere are 6 specialized schools which the Aloghar supports for the education of 110 disabled children. In addition, the project supports 1,284 physically disabled children with assistive devices, medical check-up charges, and relevant educational materials. The project also provides financial support for the accommodation and food for 350 geographically excluded children in Chittagong Hill Tracts.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 Aloghar increased the class contact hours from 3 hours to 4.25 hours for each of the two shifts that will contribute to improved learning. Aloghar also piloted Early Childhood Development (ECD) approach in 6 schools which is extended to another 75 schools since the beginning of 2017. Overall, the teachers continued to deliver joyful, life oriented and inclusive education to the children.\r\nAloghar carries out awareness raising and life skill activities for the communities it serves on basic education, child rights, health &amp; hygiene, child marriage and child protection. Teachers and project staff arrange life skill sessions in all Aloghar centres. So far nearly 150 thousand members of the community attended these meetings.\r\n\r\nThe Community is also actively engaged in education centre management, student survey, enrolment and student attendance, monitoring of teacher presence in school and observing special days. The community also provides food and accommodation to the teachers in remote areas as additional incentives. Education centre management committee (EMC) members generate local resources in cash and kind for the ECs and learners. In 2016 EMC organized 55 advocacy meetings to ensure free tuition fees/stipend for all primary school learners. The EMC also maintained regular networking with local government officials to seek opportunity for nationalization of the Aloghar schools. To date, two ECs were handed over to the community and 50 ECs were merged with government, NGO and church operated schools.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that at project closure in December 2017 Aloghar will have in excess of 46 thousand children at various levels of schooling who will need assistance for relocation/transfer to other educational facilities  in order to complete their current pre-primary and primary education. This includes a large number of adivasi/ethnic children who will find it harder than the non-ethnic children because of their language and cultural differences.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of important lessons to be learned from Aloghar Project experience. First, if children are taught in their mother language at very early stage it significantly enhances their participation and retention in schools. Secondly, the location of Aloghar schools seem to be carefully selected representing unserved or underserved areas, and the marginalized children most of whom are indigenous are well targeted. In addition, the backstopping of Aloghar schools by the churches enhanced their chances of success in the underprivileged community.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Updated:</strong> August 2017</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\r\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->Aloghar<!--:--><!--:bn-->আলোঘর<!--:-->', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'aloghar', '', '', '2017-09-13 02:38:50', '2017-09-13 02:38:50', '', 40, 'http://localhost/shareeducation/?page_id=42', 0, 'page', '', 0),

All schools established by the project were closed in December 2016 as planned with students either completing their primary education cycle or mainstreamed into government primary schools (GPS).\r\n\r\nTo meet the expected result 1 relating to ‘Access’, SHIKHON-II established 4,290 schools in remote  coastal areas, chars and haors, and Chittagong Hill Tracts. Of this number 2,629 are Non-Formal Primary Education (NFPE) schools that offer readiness to grade 5 education and 1,661 Early Primary Education (EPE) schools that offer pre-primary to grade 2 education. SHIKHON-II enrolled 119,218 (69,181 NFPE &amp; 50,037 EPE) students including 569 adivasi/ethnic children through 30 Multi Lingual Education (MLE) centres in Chittagong Hill Tracts. The EPE students are mainstreamed to government primary schools (GPS) in the neighbouring areas at grade 3. A typical SHIKHON-II school is a community-provided, one-classroom school with one teacher who delivers education to a group of 30 to 35 children.\r\n\r\nIn total 68,439 students successfully passed the government’s primary education completion examination (PECE) and 47,872 pupils were mainstreamed into GPS at grade 3 having completed three-year education from pre-primary to grade 2 in SHIKHON-II schools.\r\n\r\nUnder the expected result 2 relating to ‘Quality’, the project ensured that the children acquire the necessary competencies at primary level. For this SHIKHON-II developed class-wise and subject-based teacher training courses and published class and subject specific teachers’ guides. SHIKHON-II teachers were trained in the SHIKHON accelerated curriculum, providing them with the experience and skills needed to help further their career. On average teachers received 3.4 month technical support visits by the teacher supervisor and technical officers. Parents and family members of SHIKHON students received parenting sessions on nutrition, early childhood development, and on how best they could support their children while they learn and develop. School Management Committees (SMCs) were established at every location and trained to oversee the operation of the school, as well as to develop and execute School Improvement Plans.\r\n\r\nTo address the expected result 3 relating to ‘Linkage’ SHIKHON-II developed  close relationship and networking with government agencies at central and field level. As a result all students of SHIKHON-II project schools received government support including clearence to operate schools, take the PECE exam, and free text books. The project established primary education change makers groups among GPS teachers who wanted to bring changesand improvements in their classroom teaching learning practices. The GPS teachers used phonetic charts of SHIKHON-II to upgrade  students’ pronunciation skills as well as teachers’ guidebooks produced by the project.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\r\n\r\nSHIKHON-II completed its operation in two phases: first phase saw the closure of about 50% of schools and downsizing the staff to almost half, the later phase saw the closure of all remaining schools and termination of all staff. Both operations were carried out in planned way with least or no social problem. In various regions project closing ceremonies were held to recount the achievements and benefits of the project and to thank the local community for their support. The closing ceremonies were participated by the local communities, government officials and head masters of neighbouring government schools. SHIKHON-II successfully leveraged its strong relations with government officials to disseminate information about SHIKHON-II’s achievements while advocating for changes in government schools to make education more accessible to the marginalized. The experience of SHIKHON-II including lessons learned is being documented by Save the Children International.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Updated:</strong> August 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\r\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->SHIKHON-II<!--:-->', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'shikhon-2', '', '', '2017-09-13 02:37:05', '2017-09-13 02:37:05', '', 40, 'http://localhost/shareeducation/?page_id=44', 0, 'page', '', 0),

Another 8100 pupils will have been mainstreamed into government primary schools (GPS) at grade 1 having completed one-year pre-primary education (PPE) at SUSTAIN schools. There may not be any remaining pupil in any of the 39 project compounds at project closure.\r\n\r\nEnglish version of the government primary curriculum is piloted in 2 NFPE centres and comparative data between pilot and control centres showed higher English competency for students who were taught English through this approach. In 2016 a 3-day refresher training on the English curriculum for 10 NFPE teachers and 18 selected teachers from GPS were conducted in collaboration with Department of Primary Education (DPE) under the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME)..\r\n\r\nParents of slum children usually value children’s work and income over their education. However, through parenting education sessions that focused on the importance of education for children, child development, child protection, child rights and relevant policies have had positive impact on the attitude and actions of more than 20 thousand parents and 3 thousand employers to support children’s education and development under the project.\r\n\r\nSUSTAIN follows a mainstream sensitization strategy for education, which involves networking with formal school teachers and provide after school tutorial support and teacher-student sensitization in the formal schooling system. So far 36 thousand formal school students, 136 formal school management committee (SMC) and 1,737 teachers have been sensitized. Around 83 percent students of SUSTAIN were enrolled in grade 6 of secondary schools after completing PECE. Among them around 5 percent PECE graduates were enrolled in Technical and Vocational Education and Training Institutes (TVET) through the efforts of SUSTAIN.\r\n\r\nChild led advocacy is a key strategy that SUSTAIN uses in project areas for enhanced enrolment of students in the formal schools by reducing the hidden costs of education in public schools. A joint research was done by SUSTAIN and SHARE TA with the help of a local Consultant titled- “Hidden Causes and Costs that Hinder the Access of Working Children to Primary Education in Bangladesh.” SUSTAIN planned a national conference to disseminate the findings of the study.\r\n\r\nSo far there is no significant development on the reassessment of the competency for the grade 5 final examination (PECE)  reflecting the needs of hardest to reach children. However, SUSTAIN continues to keep the dialogue with relevant authorities.\r\n\r\nSUSTAIN has introduced a participatory monitoring and evaluation system using two kinds of tools - Quality Learning Environment (QLE) and Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability and Learning (MEAL). At the community level parent and school management committee provide their feedback through mood meter, parents-teachers meeting, addressing concerns received through information box and employers school visits and sharing. At partners level it is done through conducting M&amp;E visit, MIS, staff meeting, knowledge sharing meeting with formal school, half yearly and annual review workshop. At central level its done through project management steering committee (PMSC) meetings.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\r\n\r\nEducation for the urban working children can be successfully organized when the local community, the parents, the children and their employers collaborate with each other and accept the value of education. However, during implementation the project faced difficulties in managing the rental and maintenance costs of school compounds due to devaluation of the EURO against local currency made worse by rising inflation of the local economy. Being located in urban slums the rental of the privately owned compounds is pretty high. This together with the salary costs of 3-5 teachers make the overall costs of a 5-room school compound unsustainable without continued donor or government funding.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Updated:</strong> August 2017</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->SUSTAIN<!--:--><!--:bn-->সাস্তাইন<!--:-->', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'sustain', '', '', '2017-09-13 02:59:55', '2017-09-13 02:59:55', '', 40, 'http://localhost/shareeducation/?page_id=47', 0, 'page', '', 0);

For the first year UNIQUE-II continued to support 2,380 community-based children learning centres (CLC) established under EU funded UNIQUE-I project. At the end of first year these CLCs were transferred to local community with an enrolment of about 90,000 students. Subsequently 1850 new CLCs were established by UNIQUE-II on the basis of a baseline survey conducted in 2012. These 1,850 CLCs are reported to be in operation as of February 2017 with a total enrolment of 197,043 including about 600 adivasi children in CHT.\r\n\r\nUnder the expected result 2, a total of 1,200 learning camps were established in local government primary schools (GPS) where 28,666 low performing students of GPS received remedial academic support. For improving the quality of education, teachers and supervisors were given refresher courses. Subject based training on English and Maths were organized for teachers and supervisory staff. So far, 130 batches of subject based training were completed and a total of 2,173 teachers &amp; supervisors (1,930 female) received the training. Also, as part of foundation training, all teachers and supervisory staff of the project received training on PPE and remedial teaching camp. The NFPE teachers received pedagogic training on multi-grade teaching learning approach which is the major teaching approach developed by Dhaka Ahsania Mission. Students and teachers prepared learning materials with the locally available materials. Parents and the community participated in centre management committee (CMC) meetings in all CLCs. Joint meetings with parents and CMC members are held in every CLC for experience sharing and day to day management of the CLCs.\r\n\r\nUnder the expected result 3 UNIQUE-II engaged local government officials in various interventions. Union Parishad Standing Committees on Education (USCE) is a part of local government at union level that takes initiatives for improving education in respective unions. It also assists Union Parishad (UP) to make them more participatory and accountable for promoting quality education.  So far 3278 meetings of USCE were held and attended by respective representatives from the local government, LRC and CLCs members and UNIQUE-II project staff.  A learning Resource Centre (LRC) is established for exchange of experience, information and initiating collective actions to support quality education in the target villages. It is located in one of the CLC’s premises in every project union. 185 LRCs are now known to be functioning in the project areas. Parents and community are provided with livelihood linkage support through government’s safety net programme, micro-credit support programme, vocational skills training programme of different organizations. As part of family life education, Maa Literacy Campaign under this component titled “<em>Mayer Lekhapara </em>(Literacy for Mothers)” has facilitated literacy skills to 4,000 illiterate mothers by their own children who attend the CLCs. In addition, various national and international days are observed by the CLC community.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\r\n\r\nThe project contract states that 4,230 CLCs will run under the project in the hardest to reach locations of which 2,380 are those carried over from phase I of UNIQUE project and 1,850 newly established CLCs under UNIQUE II. At the end of 2012 or first year of the project, 2,380 CLCs were reported to have been handed over to the local community for their sustainability and management with an enrollment of 90,000 pupils. However as of December 2016 only 89 of the 2,380 CLCs are reported to be functioning, rest of the CLCs have gone out of existence. Therefore, it is also unlikely that the present 1,850 CLCs of UNIQUE-II will have a better survival rate if handed over to the local community after project closure in November 2017.\r\n\r\nAt the contract stage the project scope and targets were clearly ambitious if not inflated. It is noted that during implementation, the scope was changed in many ways and some peripheral activities were funded which may not have direct relation with children’s teaching and learning. On hind sight, it would have been more beneficial if the project had clear achievable targets of primary education completers and those mainstreamed to GPS.\r\n\r\nAn additional aspect of this project is the high overhead costs compared to three other projects. This together with the fact that only a smaller number of the NFPE students would have graduated at the end of the project makes the project rather uneconomic.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Updated:</strong> August 2017</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->UNIQUE-II<!--:-->', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'unique-2', '', '', '2017-09-13 03:12:59', '2017-09-13 03:12:59', '', 40, 'http://localhost/shareeducation/?page_id=49', 0, 'page', '', 0),

It comprises four projects implemented by NGO partners, Aloghar, SHIKHON, SUSTAIN and UNIQUE-2. Together the projects will reach 0.6 million hardest to reach children spread over 219 Upazillas. The programme is complemented by a technical assistance (TA) component providing knowledge management, capacity building, and coordination.\r\n\r\nAs part of its strategic upstream activities the TA has a facility to support research and studies that will benefit the NGO partners’ programme activities as well as larger NGO community and Government agencies working in NFE sector. The research and studies will focus on issues of high relevance to NFE sector and led by experienced international and national experts with the cooperation of SHARE partners and ideally completed in less than three months. \r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Scope </h2>\r\n\r\nWithin the framework of SHARE Programme, research topics may cover a wide area that will contribute to NFE sector development. Indicative areas include: policy planning & advocacy, teaching-learning quality improvement, enhancing school effectiveness, school- community networking, low cost school facility development, managing schools under emergencies and natural disasters, innovations and best practices in teaching-learning, multi-lingual teaching, sustainable schooling for hard to reach children, effective cooperation and networking among NGOs and Government agencies.\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The process</h2>\r\n\r\nAt the start of the annual work programme research ideas will be solicited from the partners and entered in a roaster. Research ideas may also be initiated by the TA team. A technical committee (TA team and EUD) will evaluate and shortlist the research ideas/proposals and interview the proposal writers/NGO partners. At least 3-4 research themes will be selected every year based on their research worthiness and potential impact on the quality, efficiency and innovativeness of the partners’ projects /NFE sector. Full TORs will be prepared and appropriately qualified researchers/consultants will be commissioned to conduct the research.\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The product</h2>\r\n\r\nThe research findings/outputs will be shared with partners and other interested NGOs and Government agencies/individuals in sharing seminars.

The programme instigates cross visits to the field work of the NGO programmes participating in SHARE, and was organization by SHARE Component II in conjunction with Dhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM). The programme was attended by two members of the Save the Children (Bangladesh) SUSTAIN programme and two members of the Alorgah (Lighthouse) programme of Caritas, with personnel from SHARE Component II and DAM. The full list of participants is recorded in Annex Two of this report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The party visited to three communities, in relatively inaccessible parts of the Chittagong Hill Tracts region. As an aspect of their UNIQUE II programme, DAM has set Community Learning Centres (CLC) to provide primary education to children in remote areas, who because of distance and/or language have little opportunity to attend and succeed in formal primary education settings. The CLCs offer a four year primary programme with school hours agree with the local community. </p>\r\n\r\nThe plan for the visit is to be found in Annex One. The party stayed in Rangamati and travelled to some remote villages. These villages were \r\n•	Dokhaiya Parishad\r\n•	Kolabunia in Sapchori Parishad\r\n•	Debchori in Kapatai Parishad, \r\n\r\n<p>The communities are largely Chakma speaking. The party visited three Community Learning Centres (CLC), spent time in the classrooms and speaking with teachers, supervisors, CLC members, members of the other management groups. The villages are remote, needing both boat and car to reach them. DAM emphasized the point that these are by no means the most remote villages they work with. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this report I pull together the findings presented by the participants of the trip, and raised in discussion, a round table meeting and written reports. As many were very detailed and insightful, I quote some verbatim.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"font-weight:bold; color:blue;\">Purposes of the cross field visit</h1>\r\n•	For SHARE partner NGOs to get to know each other’s work;\r\n•	For SHARE NGOs to gain benefit from information sharing and networking;\r\n•	To provide a forum for learning by contrasting and comparing differing modes of working.\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"font-weight:bold; color:blue;\">Objectives of the cross field visit</h1>\r\n•	to see one SHARE partner’s programme in action;\r\n•	to jointly analyse questions raised by the visits, in particular, those identified by individual partner NGOs;\r\n•	to begin to identify areas which could benefit from action research.\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"font-weight:bold; color:blue;\">Participants’ objectives</h1>\r\nBefore the trip, in order to promote detailed observations and an enquiring attitude, the participants were asked to reflect on their own objectives for the trip.

Conceptual issues regarding the role and responsibilities of the TA project within the broader framework of SHARE were clarified and all key stakeholders of SHARE projects have been engaged in interactive roles through frequent meetings of the SHARE Coordination Group (SCG) and regular consultations with EUD. Meaningful networking with GOB agencies is established, and the potential benefits of SHARE programme to the larger NGO community has been recognized. Policy and action research in NFPE have been initiated, and upgraded EMIS and website have been established.\r\n\r\nIn order to strengthen the capacity of result-based management via monitoring and evaluation a M&amp;E Toolkit was prepared and disseminated through a participating process where all project personnel, consultant and the TA team were involved in a highly collaborative manner.\r\n\r\nThe TA team published and distributed three comprehensive SHARE Annual Reports since 2014 and organized four Annual Conferences which were considered huge success in terms of wider participation, quality of discussions and high relevance of the themes selected. These are all documented and shared with stakeholders.\r\n\r\nFollowing the 3<sup>rd</sup> annual conference held in June 2015 a community based schooling quality improvement Initiative (CBSQ-I) was established as an alliance of about 20 like-minded NGOs. CBSQ-I conducted series of activities through which a common quality framework for basic education together with a set of minimum service standards was established. This will serve as a benchmark of quality in NGO schools.\r\n\r\nA key task of the TA is to capture, support and document the innovations and good practices developed and implemented by the partner NGOs and to reflect and learn from each other’s experience. This is being achieved through cross field visits of NGO projects; advocacy and networking between GO and NGOs; and upstream research activities and sharing of the research outcomes.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, six cross field visits were conducted in various parts of the country. Each one was participated by SHARE and Non-SHARE NGOs including BRAC, NETZ, Educo, GSS, Plan International and CAMPE. The cross-field visits enabled participants to see field level practice of other than their own, which has relevance to their work and from which they will gained new knowledge and reflective skills. External networking is established among the participating NGOs and between the NGOs and government agencies both at central and local levels\r\n\r\nTo date, Seven monographs were printed and widely distributed as knowledge products. These are: 1<em>) Innovations and Excellence in Basic Education: Evidence from International Experience; 2) Innovations and Good Practice in SHARE Education Programme; 3) Innovations and Good Practices of NGO Schools-Lessons from SHARE Third Annual Conference; 4) Mother Tongue-based Multilingual Education: Lessons Learned in SHARE Education Programme; 5) Non-Formal Primary Education: A Subsector Policy and Strategy Study; 6) Competency-based Assessment in Primary Education in Bangladesh-A Review; and 7) Hidden Causes and Costs that Hinder the Access of Working Children to Primary Education</em>.\r\n\r\nTwelve Knowledge Sharing Seminars were held for disseminating the findings of the above research studies.\r\n\r\nFive newspaper articles written by the Team Leader were published in English language dailies including the Daily Star, Dhaka Tribune and the Independent on contributions of EU funded SHARE Education Programme and lessons learned in the context of Bangladesh’s development agenda.\r\n\r\n<strong>EU’s visibility</strong> received significant boost as a result of the activities of SHARE TA through print and electronic news, newspaper articles, SHARE Facebook page, and website. As of 5 April SHARE website was visited by 85,074 visitors.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\r\n\r\nThe concept and design of the associated TA to support the overall SHARE Education Programme is innovative and highly relevant to its context. However, as the MTR Report noted had the TA been given management oversight functions, the implementation of the four discrete projects under the programme would have been more coherent and efficient. In future design of technical assistance project this lesson may be considered.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Updated:</strong> August 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->Technical Assistance<!--:-->', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'ta', '', '', '2017-09-13 03:17:08', '2017-09-13 03:17:08', '', 40, 'http://www.sajibbiswas.com/shareeducation/?page_id=162', 0, 'page', '', 0),

The education centres provided access to 156,860 (accumulated data until 31 December 2016) hardest to reach children who otherwise would not have access to any education. Todate, 7,428 pupils successfully completed Primary Education Completion Examination (PECE) and the number of PECE graduates is estimated to increase to 10,250 at the project closure.\n\nCurrently Aloghar operates 304 schools which are fully dedicated to the education of about 15,500 adivasi/ethnic children across the country. 391 education centres comprise mixed students from ethnic and Bengali communities.  At the earlier grades i.e. pre- school to grade 2 the adivasi/ethnic children receive lessons in their mother language by teachers who also speak the same language. Aloghar produced textbooks in 8 Adivasi languages for use in its mother language based classes. On completion of the early grades the ethnic children are usually inducted into the mainstream education – government primary school (GPS) or mission schools supported by the churches.\n\nThere are 6 specialized schools which the Aloghar supports for the education of 110 disabled children. In addition, the project supports 1,284 physically disabled children with assistive devices, medical check-up charges, and relevant educational materials. The project also provides financial support for the accommodation and food for 350 geographically excluded children in Chittagong Hill Tracts.\n\nIn 2016 Aloghar increased the class contact hours from 3 hours to 4.25 hours for each of the two shifts that will contribute to improved learning. Aloghar also piloted Early Childhood Development (ECD) approach in 6 schools which is extended to another 75 schools since the beginning of 2017. Overall, the teachers continued to deliver joyful, life oriented and inclusive education to the children.\nAloghar carries out awareness raising and life skill activities for the communities it serves on basic education, child rights, health &amp; hygiene, child marriage and child protection. Teachers and project staff arrange life skill sessions in all Aloghar centres. So far nearly 150 thousand members of the community attended these meetings.\n\nThe Community is also actively engaged in education centre management, student survey, enrolment and student attendance, monitoring of teacher presence in school and observing special days. The community also provides food and accommodation to the teachers in remote areas as additional incentives. Education centre management committee (EMC) members generate local resources in cash and kind for the ECs and learners. In 2016 EMC organized 55 advocacy meetings to ensure free tuition fees/stipend for all primary school learners. The EMC also maintained regular networking with local government officials to seek opportunity for nationalization of the Aloghar schools. To date, two ECs were handed over to the community and 50 ECs were merged with government, NGO and church operated schools.\n\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\n\nIt is estimated that at project closure in December 2017 Aloghar will have in excess of 46 thousand children at various levels of schooling who will need assistance for relocation/transfer to other educational facilities  in order to complete their current pre-primary and primary education. This includes a large number of adivasi/ethnic children who will find it harder than the non-ethnic children because of their language and cultural differences.\n\nThere are a couple of important lessons to be learned from Aloghar Project experience. First, if children are taught in their mother language at very early stage it significantly enhances their participation and retention in schools. Secondly, the location of Aloghar schools seem to be carefully selected representing unserved or underserved areas, and the marginalized children most of whom are indigenous are well targeted. In addition, the backstopping of Aloghar schools by the churches enhanced their chances of success in the underprivileged community.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">updated: August 2017</p>\n&nbsp;\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->Aloghar<!--:--><!--:bn-->আলোঘর<!--:-->', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '42-autosave-v1', '', '', '2017-09-13 02:21:06', '2017-09-13 02:21:06', '', 42, 'http://www.sajibbiswas.com/shareeducation/42-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Of this number 2,629 are Non-Formal Primary Education (NFPE) schools that offer readiness to grade 5 education and 1,661 Early Primary Education (EPE) schools that offer pre-primary to grade 2 education. SHIKHON-II enrolled 119,218 (69,181 NFPE &amp; 50,037 EPE) students including 569 adivasi/ethnic children through 30 Multi Lingual Education (MLE) centres in Chittagong Hill Tracts. The EPE students are mainstreamed to government primary schools (GPS) in the neighbouring areas at grade 3. A typical SHIKHON-II school is a community-provided, one-classroom school with one teacher who delivers education to a group of 30 to 35 children.\n\nIn total 68,439 students successfully passed the government’s primary education completion examination (PECE) and 47,872 pupils were mainstreamed into GPS at grade 3 having completed three-year education from pre-primary to grade 2 in SHIKHON-II schools.\n\nUnder the expected result 2 relating to ‘Quality’, the project ensured that the children acquire the necessary competencies at primary level. For this SHIKHON-II developed class-wise and subject-based teacher training courses and published class and subject specific teachers’ guides. SHIKHON-II teachers were trained in the SHIKHON accelerated curriculum, providing them with the experience and skills needed to help further their career. On average teachers received 3.4 month technical support visits by the teacher supervisor and technical officers. Parents and family members of SHIKHON students received parenting sessions on nutrition, early childhood development, and on how best they could support their children while they learn and develop. School Management Committees (SMCs) were established at every location and trained to oversee the operation of the school, as well as to develop and execute School Improvement Plans.\n\nTo address the expected result 3 relating to ‘Linkage’ SHIKHON-II developed  close relationship and networking with government agencies at central and field level. As a result all students of SHIKHON-II project schools received government support including clearence to operate schools, take the PECE exam, and free text books. The project established primary education change makers groups among GPS teachers who wanted to bring changesand improvements in their classroom teaching learning practices. The GPS teachers used phonetic charts of SHIKHON-II to upgrade  students’ pronunciation skills as well as teachers’ guidebooks produced by the project.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\n\nSHIKHON-II completed its operation in two phases: first phase saw the closure of about 50% of schools and downsizing the staff to almost half, the later phase saw the closure of all remaining schools and termination of all staff. Both operations were carried out in planned way with least or no social problem. In various regions project closing ceremonies were held to recount the achievements and benefits of the project and to thank the local community for their support. The closing ceremonies were participated by the local communities, government officials and head masters of neighbouring government schools. SHIKHON-II successfully leveraged its strong relations with government officials to disseminate information about SHIKHON-II’s achievements while advocating for changes in government schools to make education more accessible to the marginalized. The experience of SHIKHON-II including lessons learned is being documented by Save the Children International.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Updated:</strong> August 2017</p>\n\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->SHIKHON-II<!--:-->', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '44-autosave-v1', '', '', '2017-09-13 02:34:13', '2017-09-13 02:34:13', '', 44, 'http://www.sajibbiswas.com/shareeducation/44-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Another 8100 pupils will have been mainstreamed into government primary schools (GPS) at grade 1 having completed one-year pre-primary education (PPE) at SUSTAIN schools. There may not be any remaining pupil in any of the 39 project compounds at project closure.\n\nEnglish version of the government primary curriculum is piloted in 2 NFPE centres and comparative data between pilot and control centres showed higher English competency for students who were taught English through this approach. In 2016 a 3-day refresher training on the English curriculum for 10 NFPE teachers and 18 selected teachers from GPS were conducted in collaboration with Department of Primary Education (DPE) under the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME)..\n\nParents of slum children usually value children’s work and income over their education. However, through parenting education sessions that focused on the importance of education for children, child development, child protection, child rights and relevant policies have had positive impact on the attitude and actions of more than 20 thousand parents and 3 thousand employers to support children’s education and development under the project.\n\nSUSTAIN follows a mainstream sensitization strategy for education, which involves networking with formal school teachers and provide after school tutorial support and teacher-student sensitization in the formal schooling system. So far 36 thousand formal school students, 136 formal school management committee (SMC) and 1,737 teachers have been sensitized. Around 83 percent students of SUSTAIN were enrolled in grade 6 of secondary schools after completing PECE. Among them around 5 percent PECE graduates were enrolled in Technical and Vocational Education and Training Institutes (TVET) through the efforts of SUSTAIN.\n\nChild led advocacy is a key strategy that SUSTAIN uses in project areas for enhanced enrolment of students in the formal schools by reducing the hidden costs of education in public schools. A joint research was done by SUSTAIN and SHARE TA with the help of a local Consultant titled- “Hidden Causes and Costs that Hinder the Access of Working Children to Primary Education in Bangladesh.” SUSTAIN planned a national conference to disseminate the findings of the study.\n\nSo far there is no significant development on the reassessment of the competency for the grade 5 final examination (PECE)  reflecting the needs of hardest to reach children. However, SUSTAIN continues to keep the dialogue with relevant authorities.\n\nSUSTAIN has introduced a participatory monitoring and evaluation system using two kinds of tools - Quality Learning Environment (QLE) and Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability and Learning (MEAL). At the community level parent and school management committee provide their feedback through mood meter, parents-teachers meeting, addressing concerns received through information box and employers school visits and sharing. At partners level it is done through conducting M&amp;E visit, MIS, staff meeting, knowledge sharing meeting with formal school, half yearly and annual review workshop. At central level its done through project management steering committee (PMSC) meetings.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\n\n<strong>Education for the urban working children can be successfully organized when the local community, the parents, the children and their employers collaborate with each other and accept the value of education. However, during implementation the project faced difficulties in managing the rental and maintenance costs of school compounds due to devaluation of the EURO against local currency made worse by rising inflation of the local economy. Being located in urban slums the rental of the privately owned compounds is pretty high. This together with the salary costs of 3-5 teachers make the overall costs of a 5-room school compound unsustainable without continued donor or government funding.</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->SUSTAIN<!--:--><!--:bn-->সাস্তাইন<!--:-->', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '47-autosave-v1', '', '', '2017-09-13 02:58:40', '2017-09-13 02:58:40', '', 47, 'http://www.sajibbiswas.com/shareeducation/47-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

For the first year UNIQUE-II continued to support 2,380 community-based children learning centres (CLC) established under EU funded UNIQUE-I project. At the end of first year these CLCs were transferred to local community with an enrolment of about 90,000 students. Subsequently 1850 new CLCs were established by UNIQUE-II on the basis of a baseline survey conducted in 2012.

Joint meetings with parents and CMC members are held in every CLC for experience sharing and day to day management of the CLCs.\n\nUnder the expected result 3 UNIQUE-II engaged local government officials in various interventions. Union Parishad Standing Committees on Education (USCE) is a part of local government at union level that takes initiatives for improving education in respective unions. It also assists Union Parishad (UP) to make them more participatory and accountable for promoting quality education.  So far 3278 meetings of USCE were held and attended by respective representatives from the local government, LRC and CLCs members and UNIQUE-II project staff.  A learning Resource Centre (LRC) is established for exchange of experience, information and initiating collective actions to support quality education in the target villages. It is located in one of the CLC’s premises in every project union. 185 LRCs are now known to be functioning in the project areas. Parents and community are provided with livelihood linkage support through government’s safety net programme, micro-credit support programme, vocational skills training programme of different organizations. As part of family life education, Maa Literacy Campaign under this component titled “<em>Mayer Lekhapara </em>(Literacy for Mothers)” has facilitated literacy skills to 4,000 illiterate mothers by their own children who attend the CLCs. In addition, various national and international days are observed by the CLC community.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\n\nThe project contract states that 4,230 CLCs will run under the project in the hardest to reach locations of which 2,380 are those carried over from phase I of UNIQUE project and 1,850 newly established CLCs under UNIQUE II. At the end of 2012 or first year of the project, 2,380 CLCs were reported to have been handed over to the local community for their sustainability and management with an enrollment of 90,000 pupils. However as of December 2016 only 89 of the 2,380 CLCs are reported to be functioning, rest of the CLCs have gone out of existence. Therefore, it is also unlikely that the present 1,850 CLCs of UNIQUE-II will have a better survival rate if handed over to the local community after project closure in November 2017.\n\nAt the contract stage the project scope and targets were clearly ambitious if not inflated. It is noted that during implementation, the scope was changed in many ways and some peripheral activities were funded which may not have direct relation with children’s teaching and learning. On hind sight, it would have been more beneficial if the project had clear achievable targets of primary education completers and those mainstreamed to GPS.\n\nAn additional aspect of this project is the high overhead costs compared to three other projects. This together with the fact that only a smaller number of the NFPE students would have graduated at the end of the project makes the project rather uneconomic.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Updated:</strong> August 2017</p>\n&nbsp;\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->UNIQUE-II<!--:-->', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '49-autosave-v1', '', '', '2017-09-13 03:12:24', '2017-09-13 03:12:24', '', 49, 'http://www.sajibbiswas.com/shareeducation/49-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

As the Chief Guest of the programme he continued, \"Everyone here has been working together to ensure that every child receives education. The European Union is supporting the efforts of non-governmental organizations to provide primary education to children who aren\'t being reached by government programmes\".\r\n\r\n[soliloquy id=\"257\"]\r\n\r\nFour national and international partners are implementing the SHARE programme, which provides basic education and joyful learning to hard-to-reach children living in urban slums, in economically vulnerable and geographically remote areas, in ethnic minority communities, and children with special needs. Out of a total target, 280,888 students were enrolled during the first year of programme implementation, which will scale up to 655,460 students by the end of the six-year programme in 2017. Officials from government and non-government organizations actively involved with pre-primary and primary education programmes in Bangladesh attended the daylong conference. The programme was divided into several sessions, which included an opening session, presentations from NFPE projects, open discussion and a closing session.\r\n\r\nMs. Libuse Soukupova, Second Secretary &amp; Head, Human &amp; Social Development Section of Delegation of the European Union to Bangladesh, closed the conference with a brief statement that the EU is proud to support the SHARE programme, as EU\'s vision is to help Bangladesh to have an educated population. She mentioned that she has seen the programme in action in different places and discovered that the hardest to reach children now have choices in their lives. She thanked all participants and guests for their dedicated work for the children.\r\n<h1 style=\"color: blue; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; display: block; clear: both;\">Presentation Sessions : Sharing Innovation and Achievements</h1>\r\nThe renowned international expert Professor Lynn Davis from the Centre for International Education and Research, University of Birmingham, UK set the tone of the conference with her paper entitled \'International Review of Quality Education\'. She also shared her recent experience of visiting schools of the SHARE education programme and congratulated SHARE partners on their excellent work.\r\n\r\nMr. Shishir Anjelo Rozario, Programme Manager, Aloghar (Lighthouse) project described how the Aloghar project is providing a conducive learning environment for disadvantaged children in 27 districts of Bangladesh in his presentation entitled \'Innovative Education Model: Establishing Disadvantaged and Marginalized Children\'s Rights to Basic Education\'. He also informed the audience that the project has a particular focus on ethnic minority children. The project recruited teachers from the same community to help children to overcome language barriers and uses multi-lingual teaching learning aids in the classroom.\r\nMr. Kamal Hossain, Deputy Director, SHIKHON (Learning) II described how they are using their experience and learning from the project\'s first phase to scale up the second phase. In his presentation entitled \'Institutionalizing NFPE through Community Participation\' he mentioned the systematic approach to the community selection and establishing schools. Selection of students is done in collaboration with the community, local government representatives and government offices, something which helps SHIKHON II to institutionalise their programme in the community.\r\n\r\nIn his presentation \'From Work to Quality Education\', Mr. Tanvirul Islam, Programme Manager, SUSTAIN informed the audience that the SUSTAIN project is changing the lives of working children living in the slums of Dhaka and Chittagong City Corporation. The project maintains a close relationship with parents and employers, allowing students to continue their education, while working.\r\n\r\nMr. Shafiqul Islam, Project Director of UNIQUE II presented a paper entitled \'Overview of UNIQUE II\'. He explained how the project has institutionalized NFPE through community participation. He told the audience about the formation of community-based committees and their engagement with UNIQUE II.\r\n\r\nMs. Rubana Afroze, Senior Manager, BRAC Education Programme made her presentation entitled, \'BRAC\'s Non-formal Primary Education\'. She highlighted BRAC\'s approach, operational strategies and working experience with government and NGOs.\r\n\r\nMr. Suprakash Paul, Programme Manager, Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha described their innovative boat-based floating school programme and its contribution in the programme areas through his presentation entitled \'The Work of the Solar-powered Floating Schools\'. He mentioned that each boat is equipped with computer and library for children\'s use.\r\n\r\nAll presentations are available at the SHARE web site ().\r\n<h1 style=\"color: blue; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; display: block; clear: both;\">UNIQUE II picture wins EU Nobel Prize</h1>\r\nCelebratory Competition Last year EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their work in peace, reconciliation and human rights. To celebrate the award the EU organized a photo competition through EU\'s Facebook page and the UNIQUE II project won with the photo below of three girls. Here, the girls in the photograph stand in front of it with the Ambassador, Mr. William Hanna.\r\n<h1 style=\"color: blue; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; display: block; clear: both;\">Open Discussion : Learning through Sharing</h1>\r\nIn the open discussions, participants shared their thoughts and asked questions to the presenters. Here are some interesting questions and responses:\r\n\r\n<strong>Question: </strong>Does Professor Lynn Davis believe mother tongue acquisition has different impact in different places?\r\n\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>It is revealed from research that children learn better through their mother tongue, but it is also important to consider the political contexts of the societies of a country. For example, a GIZ study showed that mother tongue teaching was successful for maintaining stability in Guatemala, but studies in the Balkans have demonstrated that it reinforces partitions and restricts opportunities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Q:</strong> SHIKHON is implementing a second phase; so what are the lessons they learned in the first phase and in working with the NGO partners.\r\n\r\n<strong>A:</strong> A lot has been learned that has helped to develop the second phase of the project. An important area is teacher development. One example can be cited: in the first phase, the project developed a teachers\' guide, but it was too complicated for teachers to follow and it is currently being simplified. Also we learned about working with NGO partners. It is important to always keep in close touch with them, discuss the programme progress and decide necessary changes and actions jointly in a democratic manner.\r\n<strong>Q:</strong> Aloghar mentioned that they introduced multi-lingual education (MLE) in selected schools where there are children whose mother tongue is not Bangla. The question is how the children will cope up with mainstream schools where they have to know Bangla and English.\r\n\r\n<strong>A: </strong>Aloghar introduced MLE at pre-primary level where children need their local language to learn Bangla and English effectively. Gradually, we reduce the use of their local language and increase the use of Bangla and English, so that students of Aloghar projects do not face any problem in coping with mainstream education.\r\n\r\n<strong>Q:</strong> How did SUSTAIN developed its participatory monitoring system and how is it maintained?\r\n\r\n<strong>A: </strong>SUSTAIN has developed a monitoring manual in conjunction with the community. A pictorial chart is used to check the presence of the teacher, the children\'s attendance, whether teaching materials are put away correctly and so on. SUSTAIN also involves teachers of formal schools in the monitoring committee.\r\n\r\n<strong>Q: </strong>How do the boat schools of Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha provide education to the children?\r\n\r\n<strong>A:</strong> Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha operates boat schools in areas where most of the land is covered by water and there are no government schools. Each boat has three sessions a day. Boat schools go to collect children from their doorsteps. It starts from the boat captain\'s house and has four or five pick up points for the children. The points are selected based on their accessibility by boat. At the end of the session, the children are dropped off at the pickup point and a new set of students boards the boat.\r\n<h1 style=\"color: blue; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; display: block; clear: both;\">Teaching Learning Materials</h1>\r\nAttracted the AudiencePublications and materials from the four projects of SHARE education programme were displayed in the conference. They intrigued the audience and lit up the hall, while enhancing the theme of learning from each other.\r\n\r\n<strong>Q:</strong> How does UNIQUE II continue their education programme during emergencies?\r\n\r\n<strong>A: </strong>UNIQUE II works with parents on issues of preparedness, specifically on how education can continue in the aftermath of a disaster. This is particularly important in geographical areas prone to cyclone, flood and other recurring disasters. This is a continuous and ongoing process for UNIQUE II.\r\n\r\n<strong>Q:</strong> What is the BRAC strategy for enrolling the hard to reach children in their schools?\r\n\r\n<strong>A: </strong>BRAC is facing a number of obstacles in this process that they address with the help of community support. For example, BRAC initiated community workshops and meetings for enrolling the children of sex workers to BRAC schools but it was still difficult to get all children into schools. However, the numbers are increasing and new enrolling strategies are being planned.<!--:--><!--:bn--><a href=\"http://www.sajibbiswas.com/shareeducation/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/news-top.png\"><img src=\"http://www.sajibbiswas.com/shareeducation/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/news-top.png\" alt=\"news-top\" width=\"763\" height=\"228\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-255\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"color:blue;

As the Chief Guest of the programme he continued, \"Everyone here has been working together to ensure that every child receives education. The European Union is supporting the efforts of non-governmental organizations to provide primary education to children who aren\'t being reached by government programmes\".\n\n[soliloquy id=\"257\"]\n\nFour national and international partners are implementing the SHARE programme, which provides basic education and joyful learning to hard-to-reach children living in urban slums, in economically vulnerable and geographically remote areas, in ethnic minority communities, and children with special needs. Out of a total target, 280,888 students were enrolled during the first year of programme implementation, which will scale up to 655,460 students by the end of the six-year programme in 2017. Officials from government and non-government organizations actively involved with pre-primary and primary education programmes in Bangladesh attended the daylong conference. The programme was divided into several sessions, which included an opening session, presentations from NFPE projects, open discussion and a closing session.\n\nMs. Libuse Soukupova, Second Secretary &amp; Head, Human &amp; Social Development Section of Delegation of the European Union to Bangladesh, closed the conference with a brief statement that the EU is proud to support the SHARE programme, as EU\'s vision is to help Bangladesh to have an educated population. She mentioned that she has seen the programme in action in different places and discovered that the hardest to reach children now have choices in their lives. She thanked all participants and guests for their dedicated work for the children.\n<h1 style=\"color: blue; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; display: block; clear: both;\">Presentation Sessions : Sharing Innovation and Achievements</h1>\nThe renowned international expert Professor Lynn Davis from the Centre for International Education and Research, University of Birmingham, UK set the tone of the conference with her paper entitled \'International Review of Quality Education\'. She also shared her recent experience of visiting schools of the SHARE education programme and congratulated SHARE partners on their excellent work.\n\nMr. Shishir Anjelo Rozario, Programme Manager, Aloghar (Lighthouse) project described how the Aloghar project is providing a conducive learning environment for disadvantaged children in 27 districts of Bangladesh in his presentation entitled \'Innovative Education Model: Establishing Disadvantaged and Marginalized Children\'s Rights to Basic Education\'. He also informed the audience that the project has a particular focus on ethnic minority children. The project recruited teachers from the same community to help children to overcome language barriers and uses multi-lingual teaching learning aids in the classroom.\nMr. Kamal Hossain, Deputy Director, SHIKHON (Learning) II described how they are using their experience and learning from the project\'s first phase to scale up the second phase. In his presentation entitled \'Institutionalizing NFPE through Community Participation\' he mentioned the systematic approach to the community selection and establishing schools. Selection of students is done in collaboration with the community, local government representatives and government offices, something which helps SHIKHON II to institutionalise their programme in the community.\n\nIn his presentation \'From Work to Quality Education\', Mr. Tanvirul Islam, Programme Manager, SUSTAIN informed the audience that the SUSTAIN project is changing the lives of working children living in the slums of Dhaka and Chittagong City Corporation. The project maintains a close relationship with parents and employers, allowing students to continue their education, while working.\n\nMr. Shafiqul Islam, Project Director of UNIQUE II presented a paper entitled \'Overview of UNIQUE II\'. He explained how the project has institutionalized NFPE through community participation. He told the audience about the formation of community-based committees and their engagement with UNIQUE II.\n\nMs. Rubana Afroze, Senior Manager, BRAC Education Programme made her presentation entitled, \'BRAC\'s Non-formal Primary Education\'. She highlighted BRAC\'s approach, operational strategies and working experience with government and NGOs.\n\nMr. Suprakash Paul, Programme Manager, Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha described their innovative boat-based floating school programme and its contribution in the programme areas through his presentation entitled \'The Work of the Solar-powered Floating Schools\'. He mentioned that each boat is equipped with computer and library for children\'s use.\n\nAll presentations are available at the SHARE web site ().\n<h1 style=\"color: blue; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; display: block; clear: both;\">UNIQUE II picture wins EU Nobel Prize</h1>\nCelebratory Competition Last year EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their work in peace, reconciliation and human rights. To celebrate the award the EU organized a photo competition through EU\'s Facebook page and the UNIQUE II project won with the photo below of three girls. Here, the girls in the photograph stand in front of it with the Ambassador, Mr. William Hanna.\n<h1 style=\"color: blue; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; display: block; clear: both;\">Open Discussion : Learning through Sharing</h1>\nIn the open discussions, participants shared their thoughts and asked questions to the presenters. Here are some interesting questions and responses:\n\n<strong>Question: </strong>Does Professor Lynn Davis believe mother tongue acquisition has different impact in different places?\n\n<strong>Answer: </strong>It is revealed from research that children learn better through their mother tongue, but it is also important to consider the political contexts of the societies of a country. For example, a GIZ study showed that mother tongue teaching was successful for maintaining stability in Guatemala, but studies in the Balkans have demonstrated that it reinforces partitions and restricts opportunities.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> SHIKHON is implementing a second phase; so what are the lessons they learned in the first phase and in working with the NGO partners.\n\n<strong>A:</strong> A lot has been learned that has helped to develop the second phase of the project. An important area is teacher development. One example can be cited: in the first phase, the project developed a teachers\' guide, but it was too complicated for teachers to follow and it is currently being simplified. Also we learned about working with NGO partners. It is important to always keep in close touch with them, discuss the programme progress and decide necessary changes and actions jointly in a democratic manner.\n<strong>Q:</strong> Aloghar mentioned that they introduced multi-lingual education (MLE) in selected schools where there are children whose mother tongue is not Bangla. The question is how the children will cope up with mainstream schools where they have to know Bangla and English.\n\n<strong>A: </strong>Aloghar introduced MLE at pre-primary level where children need their local language to learn Bangla and English effectively. Gradually, we reduce the use of their local language and increase the use of Bangla and English, so that students of Aloghar projects do not face any problem in coping with mainstream education.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> How did SUSTAIN developed its participatory monitoring system and how is it maintained?\n\n<strong>A: </strong>SUSTAIN has developed a monitoring manual in conjunction with the community. A pictorial chart is used to check the presence of the teacher, the children\'s attendance, whether teaching materials are put away correctly and so on. SUSTAIN also involves teachers of formal schools in the monitoring committee.\n\n<strong>Q: </strong>How do the boat schools of Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha provide education to the children?\n\n<strong>A:</strong> Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha operates boat schools in areas where most of the land is covered by water and there are no government schools. Each boat has three sessions a day. Boat schools go to collect children from their doorsteps. It starts from the boat captain\'s house and has four or five pick up points for the children. The points are selected based on their accessibility by boat. At the end of the session, the children are dropped off at the pickup point and a new set of students boards the boat.\n<h1 style=\"color: blue; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; display: block; clear: both;\">Teaching Learning Materials</h1>\nAttracted the AudiencePublications and materials from the four projects of SHARE education programme were displayed in the conference. They intrigued the audience and lit up the hall, while enhancing the theme of learning from each other.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> How does UNIQUE II continue their education programme during emergencies?\n\n<strong>A: </strong>UNIQUE II works with parents on issues of preparedness, specifically on how education can continue in the aftermath of a disaster. This is particularly important in geographical areas prone to cyclone, flood and other recurring disasters. This is a continuous and ongoing process for UNIQUE II.\n\n<strong>Q:</strong> What is the BRAC strategy for enrolling the hard to reach children in their schools?\n\n<strong>A: </strong>BRAC is facing a number of obstacles in this process that they address with the help of community support. For example, BRAC initiated community workshops and meetings for enrolling the children of sex workers to BRAC schools but it was still difficult to get all children into schools.

The programme instigates cross visits to the field work of the NGO programmes participating in SHARE, and was organization by SHARE Component II in conjunction with Dhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM). The programme was attended by two members of the Save the Children (Bangladesh) SUSTAIN programme and two members of the Alorgah (Lighthouse) programme of Caritas, with personnel from SHARE Component II and DAM. The full list of participants is recorded in Annex Two of this report.\n\nThe party visited to three communities, in relatively inaccessible parts of the Chittagong Hill Tracts region. As an aspect of their UNIQUE II programme, DAM has set Community Learning Centres (CLC) to provide primary education to children in remote areas, who because of distance and/or language have little opportunity to attend and succeed in formal primary education settings. The CLCs offer a four year primary programme with school hours agree with the local community. \n\nThe plan for the visit is to be found in Annex One. The party stayed in Rangamati and travelled to some remote villages. These villages were \n•	Dokhaiya Parishad\n•	Kolabunia in Sapchori Parishad\n•	Debchori in Kapatai Parishad, \n\nThe communities are largely Chakma speaking. The party visited three Community Learning Centres (CLC), spent time in the classrooms and speaking with teachers, supervisors, CLC members, members of the other management groups. The villages are remote, needing both boat and car to reach them. DAM emphasized the point that these are by no means the most remote villages they work with. \n\nIn this report I pull together the findings presented by the participants of the trip, and raised in discussion, a round table meeting and written reports.

SHARE Component I is made up of four programmes: Caritas Bangladesh is implementing a project called ‘Aloghar’ (Lighthouse), Dhaka Ahsania Mission is implementing ‘Unique intervention for quality primary education -UNIQUE II’, Save the Children Bangladesh is implementing ‘SHIKHON ( Learning) II’ and ‘Support Urban Slum Children to Access Inclusive Non-Formal Education -SUSTAIN’. With a total of 49 million Euros of EU funding between them, these projects are bringing basic education to at least 650,000 children in Bangladesh who, because they have dropped out of formal school, are geographically remote, speak a home language other than Bangla, have some disability or are working or street children, do not access mainstream education.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>SHARE Component II works with Component I to support knowledge management, capacity building and coordination within the overall SHARE programme and is designed to learn and disseminate lessons about what works best and why, to share best practice, and to help build results-based-management capacity and culture, as well as facilitating linkages with the formal primary education system and other Non - Formal Education initiatives. Human Dynamics is a European TA firm selected by EU to implement Component II of the SHARE programme. Component II promotes the sharing of expertise between those working for the four SHARE partner projects and the Sharing Seminars are designed to support that sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Overview of the two SHARE Sharing Seminars</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>This document reports on the first of two Sharing Seminars held in November 2013 in Dinajpur and Savar. At the request of the partners the participants are largely supervisors and teacher trainers. Instead of the four sessions predicted in the Inception Report. two Sharing Seminars were implemented in the first year, to allow interaction between SHARE NGO partners’ staff of similar level. Both programmes took place over two and a half days, some participants travelling long distances to attend the programmes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facilitator of both programmes was Ms Manjusree Mitra supported by Valerie Emblen. The language was Bangla.The programme is to be found in Annex One. The facilitators were impressed by the knowledge and commitment of the participants. Their willingness to exchange and explore ideas was noted, with a lack of competitiveness or desire to promote the supremacy of any particular approach. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A full list of participants is to be found Annex 2. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants at the Dinajpur Sharing Seminar </p>\r\n\r\n<p> 41 participants from SHARE partners and their implementing partners took part, from the eastern part of Bangladesh.

Funded by the European Union and Dubai Cares, and carried out by Save the Children together with its implementing partners, SHIKHON is a cost-efficient, non-formal education model that responds to the needs and learning potential of millions of vulnerable children who are outside Bangladesh’s formal education system.\r\nThe SHIKHON program ensures quality education through adopting active teaching and learning methods and working hard to create a joyful learning environment, while following the curriculum and using the text books of the National Curriculum and Text Book Board of Bangladesh.  A typical SHIKHON school is a community-provided, one-classroom school with a teacher who delivers quality teaching to a group of 30-35 children between 8 and 10 years old. Children in SHIKHON schools complete a 5 year primary education in 4 years, from the readiness class through grade five, and are expected to sit the primary school completion examination. SHIKHON has developed class-wise and subject-based teacher’s training courses that ensure that the community teachers provide SHIKHON students with a quality primary school education.  The Program has also published class and subject specific teacher’s guides, to help support the teacher as they work to ensure that the children acquire the necessary competencies.\r\nThe European Union’s mid-term evaluation acknowledged the effectiveness of SHIKHON’s model in providing a high-quality primary education model for the most vulnerable children. An external evaluation, jointly endorsed by the researchers from Bangladesh and Brown University, USA assessed the competency of SHIKHON children and showed that on average SHIKHON children have achieved 21 of the 27attainable competencies.\r\nBuilding on the success in SHIKHON’s first phase, and financed by the European Union, the SHIKHON Program has begun its second five-year phase, rolling out greater coverage across Bangladesh and additional activities. In addition to the NFPE model, SHIKHON will work in formal primary schools to support quality improvements that will result in equity in primary education for vulnerable children. In the second phase, SHIKHON will work in remote rural areas, riverine chars, (low lying flood and erosion prone areas) and haors (marshlands), hills, coastal areas and disaster prone areas in six of Bangladesh’s seven divisions. This program will be implemented by national NGOs who have long experience in education programming.   Partnership with local communities is a key strength of SHIKHON schools and active participation of parents and school management committees (SMC) are vital to the success of SHIKHON schools.\r\n<h3>Global Objective</h3>\r\nTo contribute to the achievement of Bangladesh’s development goals, and to a national basic education framework.\r\n<h3>Specific Objective</h3>\r\nTo promote access and increase basic education outcomes for 160,400  of the hardest-to-reach and marginalized children, making use of lessons learned in SHIKHON’s first phase, while bringing about positive change in Bangladesh’ national education system.\r\n<h3>Target Groups</h3>\r\nOne hundred twenty-eight thousand four hundred (128,400) of the hardest-to-reach children from the poorest quintile of society living in remote disaster prone coastal areas, including chars and haors, the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and 32,000 low-performing, disadvantaged children attending formal schools in SHIKHON’s working areas. In addition, 102,720 parents of these hardest-to-reach children; 6,960 teachers and support teachers in SHIKHON schools, 47,000 local community members responsible for school management and 4,280 government education officials/teachers.\r\n<h3>Implementing Partners</h3>\r\n1.

Conceptual issues regarding the role and responsibilities of the TA project within the broader framework of SHARE were clarified and all key stakeholders of SHARE projects have been engaged in interactive roles through frequent meetings of the SHARE Coordination Group (SCG) and regular consultations with EUD. Meaningful networking with GOB agencies is established, and the potential benefits of SHARE programme to the larger NGO community has been recognized. Policy and action research in NFPE have been initiated, and upgraded EMIS and website have been established.\n\nIn order to strengthen the capacity of result-based management via monitoring and evaluation a M&amp;E Toolkit was prepared and disseminated through a participating process where all project personnel, consultant and the TA team were involved in a highly collaborative manner.\n\nThe TA team published and distributed three comprehensive SHARE Annual Reports since 2014 and organized four Annual Conferences which were considered huge success in terms of wider participation, quality of discussions and high relevance of the themes selected. These are all documented and shared with stakeholders.\n\nFollowing the 3<sup>rd</sup> annual conference held in June 2015 a community based schooling quality improvement Initiative (CBSQ-I) was established as an alliance of about 20 like-minded NGOs. CBSQ-I conducted series of activities through which a common quality framework for basic education together with a set of minimum service standards was established. This will serve as a benchmark of quality in NGO schools.\n\nA key task of the TA is to capture, support and document the innovations and good practices developed and implemented by the partner NGOs and to reflect and learn from each other’s experience. This is being achieved through cross field visits of NGO projects; advocacy and networking between GO and NGOs; and upstream research activities and sharing of the research outcomes.\n\nAccordingly, six cross field visits were conducted in various parts of the country. Each one was participated by SHARE and Non-SHARE NGOs including BRAC, NETZ, Educo, GSS, Plan International and CAMPE. The cross-field visits enabled participants to see field level practice of other than their own, which has relevance to their work and from which they will gained new knowledge and reflective skills. External networking is established among the participating NGOs and between the NGOs and government agencies both at central and local levels\n\nTo date, Seven monographs were printed and widely distributed as knowledge products. These are: 1<em>) Innovations and Excellence in Basic Education: Evidence from International Experience; 2) Innovations and Good Practice in SHARE Education Programme; 3) Innovations and Good Practices of NGO Schools-Lessons from SHARE Third Annual Conference; 4) Mother Tongue-based Multilingual Education: Lessons Learned in SHARE Education Programme; 5) Non-Formal Primary Education: A Subsector Policy and Strategy Study; 6) Competency-based Assessment in Primary Education in Bangladesh-A Review; and 7) Hidden Causes and Costs that Hinder the Access of Working Children to Primary Education</em>.\n\nTwelve Knowledge Sharing Seminars were held for disseminating the findings of the above research studies.\n\nFive newspaper articles written by the Team Leader were published in English language dailies including the Daily Star, Dhaka Tribune and the Independent on contributions of EU funded SHARE Education Programme and lessons learned in the context of Bangladesh’s development agenda.\n\n<strong>EU’s visibility</strong> received significant boost as a result of the activities of SHARE TA through print and electronic news, newspaper articles, SHARE Facebook page, and website. As of 5 April SHARE website was visited by 85,074 visitors.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\n\nThe concept and design of the associated TA to support the overall SHARE Education Programme is innovative and highly relevant to its context. However, as the MTR Report noted had the TA been given management oversight functions, the implementation of the four discrete projects under the programme would have been more coherent and efficient. In future design of technical assistance project this lesson may be considered.\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->Technical Assistance<!--:-->', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '162-autosave-v1', '', '', '2017-09-13 03:15:34', '2017-09-13 03:15:34', '', 162, 'http://www.sajibbiswas.com/shareeducation/162-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Knowledge management, capacity building and coordination have consequently been scaled up and streamlined; and they have become the core of one of the two components of the SHARE programme. Thus, Technical Assistance (TA) is concerned with knowledge management, capacity building, coordination, policy dialogue and synthesis of lessons learned. As a discrete component located within the overall SHARE programme TA is specifically designed to yield lessons about what works best and why, to share best practice, and to help build results-based-management capacity and culture, in coherent linkages with the formal primary education system and other NFE initiatives. TA has a duration of 78 months, starting on Jan 25th 2012 and ending on 24th July 2018.\r\nThe overall objective for SHARE TA component is the same as that of four SHARE projects, that is: to contribute to the achievement of Bangladesh’s development goals and to a national basic education framework.\r\n<strong><h3>The TA of the SHARE programme has four main thrusts:</h3></strong>\r\n1.	sharing experience among SHARE partner NGOs, with the NGO community at large and with Government;\r\n2.	extending and disseminating information produced by SHARE;\r\n3.	supporting the development of current practice in education;\r\n4.	supporting NGOs to improve their effectiveness, further define their roles and to forge stronger links with Government.\r\n5.	A particular work of component II is setting up of an interactive web site. It will be in action by the end of the first year of implementation and will host documents created through the project and the programme’s database.\r\nTA addresses Results Three and Four of the SHARE education programme.\r\n<strong><h3>Result Three is:</h3></strong>\r\nlessons learned, best practices and materials shared and disseminated, and used in the NGO community and, if desired by government, responsible government agencies to inform policy and practice.\r\n<strong><h3>Result Four is:</h3></strong>\r\nresults-based management institutionalised by NGOs and, if desired by government, at relevant government institutions.\r\nThis Component is implementing by a consortium led by Human Dynamics, Austria.

It serves as a vital pathway out of poverty. In Bangladesh, however, many children remain excluded from education due to the complex nature of inequities. A substantial number of children still drop out of the schooling system or discontinue their education. The effect appears even stronger with respect to girl children. Though the number and proportion of out of school children has reduced over the years in Bangladesh, it still remains considerably high and needs the attention of educational planners and administrators.\r\nDhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM) is a leading non-government organisation in Bangladesh dedicated to improving the human condition of the disadvantaged people of the society. With its enduring growth over time, DAM has implemented a large number of projects covering different areas of development. Education always remains at the top of the DAM’s development agenda. Considering non-formal education as a means of integration into society, DAM has contributed significantly towards influencing change for prevailing non-formal education system in Bangladesh.\r\nUnique Intervention for Quality Primary Education-UNIQUE II is a 6-year project started its activities in December 2011. The project is being implemented with financial support of the European Union. The major objective of the project is to impart quality education to out-of-school and drop-out children particularly from the disadvantaged group through the opening of complete multigrade classes. It also intends to provide remedial services to the slow learners of targeted government and registered primary schools. UNIQUE-II aims at promoting, facilitating and managing greater community involvement and allowing the local community to participate at all stages of the project cycle. The project works for creating sufficient ownership of the local people with the aim of making more resilient and vibrant communities.\r\n<strong>Overall objective</strong>\r\nTo contribute to develop a collaborative basic education system that enables primary school aged children to avail quality education\r\n<strong>Specific objectives</strong>\r\n1.	To provide primary and pre-primary education to 297,467 disadvantaged children from the targeted geographically susceptible upazilas\r\n2.	To develop institutional collaboration and horizontal learning mechanism between formal and non-formal primary education providers\r\n3.	To document and disseminate effective practices and lessons\r\n4.	Key Expected Results\r\n5.	Effectiveness of non-formal primary education programmes increased in 26 targeted districts through reaching the out-of-school children and catering for their learning needs\r\n6.	Children’s performance improved in formal schools of targeted 84 upazilas\r\n7.	Child-centred learning community and supportive environment developed in the targeted 454 unions of the project\r\n\r\n<strong>Basic Facts</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.sajibbiswas.com/shareeducation/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2323.png\"><img src=\"http://www.sajibbiswas.com/shareeducation/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2323.png\" alt=\"2323\" width=\"598\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-307\" /></a>\r\n<strong>\r\nMain Activities</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.sajibbiswas.com/shareeducation/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/32323.png\"><img src=\"http://www.sajibbiswas.com/shareeducation/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/32323.png\" alt=\"32323\" width=\"578\" height=\"495\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-308\" /></a>\r\n<strong>\r\nProject Partners</strong>\r\nThe project is being implemented by a consortium of partners with Dhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM) as the lead agency. The other implementing partners of the project include Assistance for Social Organization and Development (ASOD), Christian Commission for Development in Bangladesh (CCDB), Development Organisation of the Rural Poor (DORP), Padakhep Manabik Unnayan Kendra (PMUK), SUROVI, Voluntary Association for Rural Development (VARD) and Young Power in Social Action (YPSA). Besides, Plan Bangladesh supports the project as a technical partner.\r\nProject Implementation and Management\r\nThe UNIQUE-II project is being implemented through a decentralised management system to afford substantial autonomy at all levels of operation. The Central Team is supported through 8 Regional and 71 Area Offices. All Children Learning Centres (CLC) are managed by the community through CLC Management Committees (CMC). CLCs are usually multipurpose centres for the local community as a whole. Besides, a Learning Resource Centre (LRC) is operated and managed by the community people in each of the unions of the project area.

The programme instigates cross visits to the field work of the NGO programmes participating in SHARE, and was organization by SHARE Component II in conjunction with Dhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM). The programme was attended by two members of the Save the Children (Bangladesh) SUSTAIN programme and two members of the Alorgah (Lighthouse) programme of Caritas, with personnel from SHARE Component II and DAM. The full list of participants is recorded in Annex Two of this report.\r\n\r\nThe party visited to three communities, in relatively inaccessible parts of the Chittagong Hill Tracts region. As an aspect of their UNIQUE II programme, DAM has set Community Learning Centres (CLC) to provide primary education to children in remote areas, who because of distance and/or language have little opportunity to attend and succeed in formal primary education settings. The CLCs offer a four year primary programme with school hours agree with the local community. \r\n\r\nThe plan for the visit is to be found in Annex One. The party stayed in Rangamati and travelled to some remote villages. These villages were \r\n•	Dokhaiya Parishad\r\n•	Kolabunia in Sapchori Parishad\r\n•	Debchori in Kapatai Parishad, \r\n\r\nThe communities are largely Chakma speaking. The party visited three Community Learning Centres (CLC), spent time in the classrooms and speaking with teachers, supervisors, CLC members, members of the other management groups. The villages are remote, needing both boat and car to reach them. DAM emphasized the point that these are by no means the most remote villages they work with. \r\n\r\nIn this report I pull together the findings presented by the participants of the trip, and raised in discussion, a round table meeting and written reports. As many were very detailed and insightful, I quote some verbatim.\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"font-weight:bold; color:blue;\">Purposes of the cross field visit</h1>\r\n•	For SHARE partner NGOs to get to know each other’s work;\r\n•	For SHARE NGOs to gain benefit from information sharing and networking;\r\n•	To provide a forum for learning by contrasting and comparing differing modes of working.\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"font-weight:bold; color:blue;\">Objectives of the cross field visit</h1>\r\n•	to see one SHARE partner’s programme in action;\r\n•	to jointly analyse questions raised by the visits, in particular, those identified by individual partner NGOs;\r\n•	to begin to identify areas which could benefit from action research.\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"font-weight:bold; color:blue;\">Participants’ objectives</h1>\r\nBefore the trip, in order to promote detailed observations and an enquiring attitude, the participants were asked to reflect on their own objectives for the trip.

The programme instigates cross visits to the field work of the NGO programmes participating in SHARE, and was organization by SHARE Component II in conjunction with Dhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM). The programme was attended by two members of the Save the Children (Bangladesh) SUSTAIN programme and two members of the Alorgah (Lighthouse) programme of Caritas, with personnel from SHARE Component II and DAM. The full list of participants is recorded in Annex Two of this report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The party visited to three communities, in relatively inaccessible parts of the Chittagong Hill Tracts region. As an aspect of their UNIQUE II programme, DAM has set Community Learning Centres (CLC) to provide primary education to children in remote areas, who because of distance and/or language have little opportunity to attend and succeed in formal primary education settings. The CLCs offer a four year primary programme with school hours agree with the local community. </p>\r\n\r\nThe plan for the visit is to be found in Annex One. The party stayed in Rangamati and travelled to some remote villages. These villages were \r\n•	Dokhaiya Parishad\r\n•	Kolabunia in Sapchori Parishad\r\n•	Debchori in Kapatai Parishad, \r\n\r\n<p>The communities are largely Chakma speaking. The party visited three Community Learning Centres (CLC), spent time in the classrooms and speaking with teachers, supervisors, CLC members, members of the other management groups. The villages are remote, needing both boat and car to reach them. DAM emphasized the point that these are by no means the most remote villages they work with. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this report I pull together the findings presented by the participants of the trip, and raised in discussion, a round table meeting and written reports.

Funded by the European Union and Dubai Cares, and carried out by Save the Children together with its implementing partners, SHIKHON is a cost-efficient, non-formal education model that responds to the needs and learning potential of millions of vulnerable children who are outside Bangladesh’s formal education system.\r\nThe SHIKHON program ensures quality education through adopting active teaching and learning methods and working hard to create a joyful learning environment, while following the curriculum and using the text books of the National Curriculum and Text Book Board of Bangladesh.  A typical SHIKHON school is a community-provided, one-classroom school with a teacher who delivers quality teaching to a group of 30-35 children between 8 and 10 years old. Children in SHIKHON schools complete a 5 year primary education in 4 years, from the readiness class through grade five, and are expected to sit the primary school completion examination. SHIKHON has developed class-wise and subject-based teacher’s training courses that ensure that the community teachers provide SHIKHON students with a quality primary school education.  The Program has also published class and subject specific teacher’s guides, to help support the teacher as they work to ensure that the children acquire the necessary competencies.\r\nThe European Union’s mid-term evaluation acknowledged the effectiveness of SHIKHON’s model in providing a high-quality primary education model for the most vulnerable children. An external evaluation, jointly endorsed by the researchers from Bangladesh and Brown University, USA assessed the competency of SHIKHON children and showed that on average SHIKHON children have achieved 21 of the 27attainable competencies.\r\nBuilding on the success in SHIKHON’s first phase, and financed by the European Union, the SHIKHON Program has begun its second five-year phase, rolling out greater coverage across Bangladesh and additional activities. In addition to the NFPE model, SHIKHON will work in formal primary schools to support quality improvements that will result in equity in primary education for vulnerable children. In the second phase, SHIKHON will work in remote rural areas, riverine chars, (low lying flood and erosion prone areas) and haors (marshlands), hills, coastal areas and disaster prone areas in six of Bangladesh’s seven divisions. This program will be implemented by national NGOs who have long experience in education programming.   Partnership with local communities is a key strength of SHIKHON schools and active participation of parents and school management committees (SMC) are vital to the success of SHIKHON schools.\r\n<h3>Global Objective</h3>\r\nTo contribute to the achievement of Bangladesh’s development goals, and to a national basic education framework.\r\n<h3>Specific Objective</h3>\r\nTo promote access and increase basic education outcomes for 160,400  of the hardest-to-reach and marginalized children, making use of lessons learned in SHIKHON’s first phase, while bringing about positive change in Bangladesh’ national education system.\r\n<h3>Target Groups</h3>\r\nOne hundred twenty-eight thousand four hundred (128,400) of the hardest-to-reach children from the poorest quintile of society living in remote disaster prone coastal areas, including chars and haors, the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and 32,000 low-performing, disadvantaged children attending formal schools in SHIKHON’s working areas. In addition, 102,720 parents of these hardest-to-reach children; 6,960 teachers and support teachers in SHIKHON schools, 47,000 local community members responsible for school management and 4,280 government education officials/teachers.\r\n<h3>Implementing Partners</h3>\r\n1.

It serves as a vital pathway out of poverty. In Bangladesh, however, many children remain excluded from education due to the complex nature of inequities. A substantial number of children still drop out of the schooling system or discontinue their education. The effect appears even stronger with respect to girl children. Though the number and proportion of out of school children has reduced over the years in Bangladesh, it still remains considerably high and needs the attention of educational planners and administrators.\r\nDhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM) is a leading non-government organisation in Bangladesh dedicated to improving the human condition of the disadvantaged people of the society. With its enduring growth over time, DAM has implemented a large number of projects covering different areas of development. Education always remains at the top of the DAM’s development agenda. Considering non-formal education as a means of integration into society, DAM has contributed significantly towards influencing change for prevailing non-formal education system in Bangladesh.\r\nUnique Intervention for Quality Primary Education-UNIQUE II is a 6-year project started its activities in December 2011. The project is being implemented with financial support of the European Union.

It serves as a vital pathway out of poverty. In Bangladesh, however, many children remain excluded from education due to the complex nature of inequities. A substantial number of children still drop out of the schooling system or discontinue their education. The effect appears even stronger with respect to girl children. Though the number and proportion of out of school children has reduced over the years in Bangladesh, it still remains considerably high and needs the attention of educational planners and administrators.\r\nDhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM) is a leading non-government organisation in Bangladesh dedicated to improving the human condition of the disadvantaged people of the society. With its enduring growth over time, DAM has implemented a large number of projects covering different areas of development. Education always remains at the top of the DAM’s development agenda. Considering non-formal education as a means of integration into society, DAM has contributed significantly towards influencing change for prevailing non-formal education system in Bangladesh.\r\nUnique Intervention for Quality Primary Education-UNIQUE II is a 6-year project started its activities in December 2011.

Funded by the European Union and Dubai Cares, and carried out by Save the Children together with its implementing partners, SHIKHON is a cost-efficient, non-formal education model that responds to the needs and learning potential of millions of vulnerable children who are outside Bangladesh’s formal education system.\r\nThe SHIKHON program ensures quality education through adopting active teaching and learning methods and working hard to create a joyful learning environment, while following the curriculum and using the text books of the National Curriculum and Text Book Board of Bangladesh.  A typical SHIKHON school is a community-provided, one-classroom school with a teacher who delivers quality teaching to a group of 30-35 children between 8 and 10 years old. Children in SHIKHON schools complete a 5 year primary education in 4 years, from the readiness class through grade five, and are expected to sit the primary school completion examination. SHIKHON has developed class-wise and subject-based teacher’s training courses that ensure that the community teachers provide SHIKHON students with a quality primary school education.  The Program has also published class and subject specific teacher’s guides, to help support the teacher as they work to ensure that the children acquire the necessary competencies.\r\nThe European Union’s mid-term evaluation acknowledged the effectiveness of SHIKHON’s model in providing a high-quality primary education model for the most vulnerable children. An external evaluation, jointly endorsed by the researchers from Bangladesh and Brown University, USA assessed the competency of SHIKHON children and showed that on average SHIKHON children have achieved 21 of the 27attainable competencies.\r\nBuilding on the success in SHIKHON’s first phase, and financed by the European Union, the SHIKHON Program has begun its second five-year phase, rolling out greater coverage across Bangladesh and additional activities. In addition to the NFPE model, SHIKHON will work in formal primary schools to support quality improvements that will result in equity in primary education for vulnerable children. In the second phase, SHIKHON will work in remote rural areas, riverine chars, (low lying flood and erosion prone areas) and haors (marshlands), hills, coastal areas and disaster prone areas in six of Bangladesh’s seven divisions. This program will be implemented by national NGOs who have long experience in education programming.   Partnership with local communities is a key strength of SHIKHON schools and active participation of parents and school management committees (SMC) are vital to the success of SHIKHON schools.\r\n<h3>Global Objective</h3>\r\nTo contribute to the achievement of Bangladesh’s development goals, and to a national basic education framework.\r\n<h3>Specific Objective</h3>\r\nTo promote access and increase basic education outcomes for 160,400  of the hardest-to-reach and marginalized children, making use of lessons learned in SHIKHON’s first phase, while bringing about positive change in Bangladesh’ national education system.\r\n<h3>Target Groups</h3>\r\nOne hundred twenty-eight thousand four hundred (128,400) of the hardest-to-reach children from the poorest quintile of society living in remote disaster prone coastal areas, including chars and haors, the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and 32,000 low-performing, disadvantaged children attending formal schools in SHIKHON’s working areas. In addition, 102,720 parents of these hardest-to-reach children; 6,960 teachers and support teachers in SHIKHON schools, 47,000 local community members responsible for school management and 4,280 government education officials/teachers.\r\n<h3>Implementing Partners</h3>\r\n1.

It serves as a vital pathway out of poverty. In Bangladesh, however, many children remain excluded from education due to the complex nature of inequities. A substantial number of children still drop out of the schooling system or discontinue their education. The effect appears even stronger with respect to girl children. Though the number and proportion of out of school children has reduced over the years in Bangladesh, it still remains considerably high and needs the attention of educational planners and administrators.\r\nDhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM) is a leading non-government organisation in Bangladesh dedicated to improving the human condition of the disadvantaged people of the society. With its enduring growth over time, DAM has implemented a large number of projects covering different areas of development. Education always remains at the top of the DAM’s development agenda. Considering non-formal education as a means of integration into society, DAM has contributed significantly towards influencing change for prevailing non-formal education system in Bangladesh.\r\nUnique Intervention for Quality Primary Education-UNIQUE II is a 6-year project started its activities in December 2011. The project is being implemented with financial support of the European Union. The major objective of the project is to impart quality education to out-of-school and drop-out children particularly from the disadvantaged group through the opening of complete multigrade classes. It also intends to provide remedial services to the slow learners of targeted government and registered primary schools. UNIQUE-II aims at promoting, facilitating and managing greater community involvement and allowing the local community to participate at all stages of the project cycle. The project works for creating sufficient ownership of the local people with the aim of making more resilient and vibrant communities.\r\n<strong>Overall objective</strong>\r\nTo contribute to develop a collaborative basic education system that enables primary school aged children to avail quality education\r\n<strong>Specific objectives</strong>\r\n1. To provide primary and pre-primary education to 297,467 disadvantaged children from the targeted geographically susceptible upazilas\r\n2. To develop institutional collaboration and horizontal learning mechanism between formal and non-formal primary education providers\r\n3. To document and disseminate effective practices and lessons\r\n4. Key Expected Results\r\n5. Effectiveness of non-formal primary education programmes increased in 26 targeted districts through reaching the out-of-school children and catering for their learning needs\r\n6. Children’s performance improved in formal schools of targeted 84 upazilas\r\n7. Child-centred learning community and supportive environment developed in the targeted 454 unions of the project\r\n\r\n<strong>Project Partners</strong>\r\nThe project is being implemented by a consortium of partners with Dhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM) as the lead agency. The other implementing partners of the project include Assistance for Social Organization and Development (ASOD), Christian Commission for Development in Bangladesh (CCDB), Development Organisation of the Rural Poor (DORP), Padakhep Manabik Unnayan Kendra (PMUK), SUROVI, Voluntary Association for Rural Development (VARD) and Young Power in Social Action (YPSA). Besides, Plan Bangladesh supports the project as a technical partner.\r\n\r\n<strong>Project Implementation and Management</strong>\r\nThe UNIQUE-II project is being implemented through a decentralised management system to afford substantial autonomy at all levels of operation. The Central Team is supported through 8 Regional and 71 Area Offices. All Children Learning Centres (CLC) are managed by the community through CLC Management Committees (CMC). CLCs are usually multipurpose centres for the local community as a whole. Besides, a Learning Resource Centre (LRC) is operated and managed by the community people in each of the unions of the project area. LRCs offer a wide range of community managed programmes and services.\r\n\r\n<strong>Geographical Coverage</strong>\r\nBandarban, Bagherhat, Barguna, Barisal, Bhola, Dhaka, Dinajpur, Rangamati, Chittagong, Feni, Gaibandha, Gazipur, Jamalpur, Khagrachari, Kishorgonj, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Laxmipur, Mymensingh, Narayanganj, Netrokona, Nilphamari, Noakhali, Patuakhali, Rangpur, and Satkhira.\r\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div><!--:-->', '<!--:en-->UNIQUE-II<!--:-->', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '49-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-06-18 02:51:54', '2015-06-18 02:51:54', '', 49, 'http://share-education.org/49-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Therefore, this organization has been operating different projects over four decades in the arena of formal, non-formal and vocational education for the poor, hard to reach and underprivileged children including different indigenous communities, excluded and untouchable backgrounds.\r\nTo enhance contribution to national education framework by increasing literacy rate among the disadvantaged children and creating an opportunity for them to acquire skills and become efficient citizens, Caritas Bangladesh initiated six-year project titled \"Aloghar (Lighthouse) - Supporting the Hardest to Reach Through Basic Education (SHARE)\" in November 2011 with financial support of the European Union and Secours Catholique - Caritas France.\r\nAloghar mainly focuses on basic inclusive primary education through non-formal environment with arrangement of 1,005 education centers for the poverty stricken children who live in the most inaccessible areas including the indigenous communities and those with special needs. The project actions are designed to supplement government efforts to achieve development goal. The community teachers impart quality education to the disadvantaged children from early childhood to grade five through multi-grade approach using textbooks of National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) along with supplementary books and teaching aids in a joyful atmosphere. There is a provision for indigenous pupils to learn in their mother tongue side by side Bengali. This intervention is expected to equip the enrolled pupils with competencies and human qualities towards overall development and self-reliance.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n<h3><strong>Goal</strong><strong></strong></h3>\r\nIncreased empowerment, enhanced literacy, self-reliance and better social integration of the disadvantaged and hardest to reach children.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n<h3><strong>Specific Objective</strong><strong></strong></h3>\r\nThe hardest to reach children enjoy their right to quality basic education at pre and primary level, and equal opportunities for inclusion in mainstream education at secondary level.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n<h3><strong>Expected Results</strong></h3>\r\n1. Disadvantaged communities have ready access to effectively functioning education centers conducive to learning environment.\r\n2. Indigenous children at pre and primary level have the opportunity to learn in their native languages in addition to Bengali\r\n3.

Funded by the European Union and Dubai Cares, and carried out by Save the Children together with its implementing partners, SHIKHON is a cost-efficient, non-formal education model that responds to the needs and learning potential of millions of vulnerable children who are outside Bangladesh’s formal education system.\r\n\r\nThe SHIKHON program ensures quality education through adopting active teaching and learning methods and working hard to create a joyful learning environment, while following the curriculum and using the text books of the National Curriculum and Text Book Board of Bangladesh. A typical SHIKHON school is a community-provided, one-classroom school with a teacher who delivers quality teaching to a group of 30-35 children between 8 and 10 years old. Children in SHIKHON schools complete a 5 year primary education in 4 years, from the readiness class through grade five, and are expected to sit the primary school completion examination. SHIKHON has developed class-wise and subject-based teacher’s training courses that ensure that the community teachers provide SHIKHON students with a quality primary school education. The Program has also published class and subject specific teacher’s guides, to help support the teacher as they work to ensure that the children acquire the necessary competencies.\r\n\r\nThe European Union’s mid-term evaluation acknowledged the effectiveness of SHIKHON’s model in providing a high-quality primary education model for the most vulnerable children. An external evaluation, jointly endorsed by the researchers from Bangladesh and Brown University, USA assessed the competency of SHIKHON children and showed that on average SHIKHON children have achieved 21 of the 27attainable competencies.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the success in SHIKHON’s first phase, and financed by the European Union, the SHIKHON Program has begun its second five-year phase, rolling out greater coverage across Bangladesh and additional activities.

The education centres provided access to 156,860 (accumulated data until 31 December 2016) hardest to reach children who otherwise would not have access to any education. Todate, 7,428 pupils successfully completed Primary Education Completion Examination (PECE) and the number of PECE graduates is estimated to increase to 10,250 at the project closure.\r\n\r\nCurrently Aloghar operates 304 schools which are fully dedicated to the education of about 15,500 adivasi/ethnic children across the country. 391 education centres comprise mixed students from ethnic and Bengali communities.  At the earlier grades i.e. pre- school to grade 2 the adivasi/ethnic children receive lessons in their mother language by teachers who also speak the same language. Aloghar produced textbooks in 8 Adivasi languages for use in its mother language based classes. On completion of the early grades the ethnic children are usually inducted into the mainstream education – government primary school (GPS) or mission schools supported by the churches.\r\n\r\nThere are 6 specialized schools which the Aloghar supports for the education of 110 disabled children. In addition, the project supports 1,284 physically disabled children with assistive devices, medical check-up charges, and relevant educational materials. The project also provides financial support for the accommodation and food for 350 geographically excluded children in Chittagong Hill Tracts.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 Aloghar increased the class contact hours from 3 hours to 4.25 hours for each of the two shifts that will contribute to improved learning. Aloghar also piloted Early Childhood Development (ECD) approach in 6 schools which is extended to another 75 schools since the beginning of 2017. Overall, the teachers continued to deliver joyful, life oriented and inclusive education to the children.\r\nAloghar carries out awareness raising and life skill activities for the communities it serves on basic education, child rights, health &amp; hygiene, child marriage and child protection. Teachers and project staff arrange life skill sessions in all Aloghar centres. So far nearly 150 thousand members of the community attended these meetings.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Community is also actively engaged in education centre management, student survey, enrolment and student attendance, monitoring of teacher presence in school and observing special days. The community also provides food and accommodation to the teachers in remote areas as additional incentives. Education centre management committee (EMC) members generate local resources in cash and kind for the ECs and learners. In 2016 EMC organized 55 advocacy meetings to ensure free tuition fees/stipend for all primary school learners. The EMC also maintained regular networking with local government officials to seek opportunity for nationalization of the Aloghar schools. To date, two ECs were handed over to the community and 50 ECs were merged with government, NGO and church operated schools.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that at project closure in December 2017 Aloghar will have in excess of 46 thousand children at various levels of schooling who will need assistance for relocation/transfer to other educational facilities  in order to complete their current pre-primary and primary education. This includes a large number of adivasi/ethnic children who will find it harder than the non-ethnic children because of their language and cultural differences.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of important lessons to be learned from Aloghar Project experience. First, if children are taught in their mother language at very early stage it significantly enhances their participation and retention in schools. Secondly, the location of Aloghar schools seem to be carefully selected representing unserved or underserved areas, and the marginalized children most of whom are indigenous are well targeted. In addition, the backstopping of Aloghar schools by the churches enhanced their chances of success in the underprivileged community.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">updated: August 2017</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\r\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->Aloghar<!--:--><!--:bn-->আলোঘর<!--:-->', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '42-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-09-13 02:06:15', '2017-09-13 02:06:15', '', 42, 'http://share-education.org/42-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The education centres provided access to 156,860 (accumulated data until 31 December 2016) hardest to reach children who otherwise would not have access to any education. Todate, 7,428 pupils successfully completed Primary Education Completion Examination (PECE) and the number of PECE graduates is estimated to increase to 10,250 at the project closure.\r\n\r\nCurrently Aloghar operates 304 schools which are fully dedicated to the education of about 15,500 adivasi/ethnic children across the country. 391 education centres comprise mixed students from ethnic and Bengali communities.  At the earlier grades i.e. pre- school to grade 2 the adivasi/ethnic children receive lessons in their mother language by teachers who also speak the same language. Aloghar produced textbooks in 8 Adivasi languages for use in its mother language based classes. On completion of the early grades the ethnic children are usually inducted into the mainstream education – government primary school (GPS) or mission schools supported by the churches.\r\n\r\nThere are 6 specialized schools which the Aloghar supports for the education of 110 disabled children. In addition, the project supports 1,284 physically disabled children with assistive devices, medical check-up charges, and relevant educational materials. The project also provides financial support for the accommodation and food for 350 geographically excluded children in Chittagong Hill Tracts.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 Aloghar increased the class contact hours from 3 hours to 4.25 hours for each of the two shifts that will contribute to improved learning. Aloghar also piloted Early Childhood Development (ECD) approach in 6 schools which is extended to another 75 schools since the beginning of 2017. Overall, the teachers continued to deliver joyful, life oriented and inclusive education to the children.\r\nAloghar carries out awareness raising and life skill activities for the communities it serves on basic education, child rights, health &amp; hygiene, child marriage and child protection. Teachers and project staff arrange life skill sessions in all Aloghar centres. So far nearly 150 thousand members of the community attended these meetings.\r\n\r\nThe Community is also actively engaged in education centre management, student survey, enrolment and student attendance, monitoring of teacher presence in school and observing special days. The community also provides food and accommodation to the teachers in remote areas as additional incentives. Education centre management committee (EMC) members generate local resources in cash and kind for the ECs and learners. In 2016 EMC organized 55 advocacy meetings to ensure free tuition fees/stipend for all primary school learners. The EMC also maintained regular networking with local government officials to seek opportunity for nationalization of the Aloghar schools. To date, two ECs were handed over to the community and 50 ECs were merged with government, NGO and church operated schools.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that at project closure in December 2017 Aloghar will have in excess of 46 thousand children at various levels of schooling who will need assistance for relocation/transfer to other educational facilities  in order to complete their current pre-primary and primary education. This includes a large number of adivasi/ethnic children who will find it harder than the non-ethnic children because of their language and cultural differences.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of important lessons to be learned from Aloghar Project experience. First, if children are taught in their mother language at very early stage it significantly enhances their participation and retention in schools. Secondly, the location of Aloghar schools seem to be carefully selected representing unserved or underserved areas, and the marginalized children most of whom are indigenous are well targeted. In addition, the backstopping of Aloghar schools by the churches enhanced their chances of success in the underprivileged community.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Updated:</strong> August 2017</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\r\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->Aloghar<!--:--><!--:bn-->আলোঘর<!--:-->', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '42-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-09-13 02:22:35', '2017-09-13 02:22:35', '', 42, 'http://share-education.org/42-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

All schools established by the project were closed in December 2016 as planned with students either completing their primary education cycle or mainstreamed into government primary schools (GPS).\r\n\r\nTo meet the expected result 1 relating to ‘Access’, SHIKHON-II established 4,290 schools in remote  coastal areas, chars and haors, and Chittagong Hill Tracts. Of this number 2,629 are Non-Formal Primary Education (NFPE) schools that offer readiness to grade 5 education and 1,661 Early Primary Education (EPE) schools that offer pre-primary to grade 2 education. SHIKHON-II enrolled 119,218 (69,181 NFPE &amp; 50,037 EPE) students including 569 adivasi/ethnic children through 30 Multi Lingual Education (MLE) centres in Chittagong Hill Tracts. The EPE students are mainstreamed to government primary schools (GPS) in the neighbouring areas at grade 3. A typical SHIKHON-II school is a community-provided, one-classroom school with one teacher who delivers education to a group of 30 to 35 children.\r\n\r\nIn total 68,439 students successfully passed the government’s primary education completion examination (PECE) and 47,872 pupils were mainstreamed into GPS at grade 3 having completed three-year education from pre-primary to grade 2 in SHIKHON-II schools.\r\n\r\nUnder the expected result 2 relating to ‘Quality’, the project ensured that the children acquire the necessary competencies at primary level. For this SHIKHON-II developed class-wise and subject-based teacher training courses and published class and subject specific teachers’ guides. SHIKHON-II teachers were trained in the SHIKHON accelerated curriculum, providing them with the experience and skills needed to help further their career. On average teachers received 3.4 month technical support visits by the teacher supervisor and technical officers. Parents and family members of SHIKHON students received parenting sessions on nutrition, early childhood development, and on how best they could support their children while they learn and develop. School Management Committees (SMCs) were established at every location and trained to oversee the operation of the school, as well as to develop and execute School Improvement Plans.\r\n\r\nTo address the expected result 3 relating to ‘Linkage’ SHIKHON-II developed  close relationship and networking with government agencies at central and field level. As a result all students of SHIKHON-II project schools received government support including clearence to operate schools, take the PECE exam, and free text books. The project established primary education change makers groups among GPS teachers who wanted to bring changesand improvements in their classroom teaching learning practices. The GPS teachers used phonetic charts of SHIKHON-II to upgrade  students’ pronunciation skills as well as teachers’ guidebooks produced by the project.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\r\n\r\nSHIKHON-II completed its operation in two phases: first phase saw the closure of about 50% of schools and downsizing the staff to almost half, the later phase saw the closure of all remaining schools and termination of all staff. Both operations were carried out in planned way with least or no social problem. In various regions project closing ceremonies were held to recount the achievements and benefits of the project and to thank the local community for their support. The closing ceremonies were participated by the local communities, government officials and head masters of neighbouring government schools. SHIKHON-II successfully leveraged its strong relations with government officials to disseminate information about SHIKHON-II’s achievements while advocating for changes in government schools to make education more accessible to the marginalized.

SHIKHON-II enrolled 119,218 (69,181 NFPE &amp; 50,037 EPE) students including 569 adivasi/ethnic children through 30 Multi Lingual Education (MLE) centres in Chittagong Hill Tracts. The EPE students are mainstreamed to government primary schools (GPS) in the neighbouring areas at grade 3. A typical SHIKHON-II school is a community-provided, one-classroom school with one teacher who delivers education to a group of 30 to 35 children.\r\n\r\nIn total 68,439 students successfully passed the government’s primary education completion examination (PECE) and 47,872 pupils were mainstreamed into GPS at grade 3 having completed three-year education from pre-primary to grade 2 in SHIKHON-II schools.\r\n\r\nUnder the expected result 2 relating to ‘Quality’, the project ensured that the children acquire the necessary competencies at primary level. For this SHIKHON-II developed class-wise and subject-based teacher training courses and published class and subject specific teachers’ guides. SHIKHON-II teachers were trained in the SHIKHON accelerated curriculum, providing them with the experience and skills needed to help further their career. On average teachers received 3.4 month technical support visits by the teacher supervisor and technical officers. Parents and family members of SHIKHON students received parenting sessions on nutrition, early childhood development, and on how best they could support their children while they learn and develop. School Management Committees (SMCs) were established at every location and trained to oversee the operation of the school, as well as to develop and execute School Improvement Plans.\r\n\r\nTo address the expected result 3 relating to ‘Linkage’ SHIKHON-II developed  close relationship and networking with government agencies at central and field level. As a result all students of SHIKHON-II project schools received government support including clearence to operate schools, take the PECE exam, and free text books. The project established primary education change makers groups among GPS teachers who wanted to bring changesand improvements in their classroom teaching learning practices. The GPS teachers used phonetic charts of SHIKHON-II to upgrade  students’ pronunciation skills as well as teachers’ guidebooks produced by the project.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\r\n\r\nSHIKHON-II completed its operation in two phases: first phase saw the closure of about 50% of schools and downsizing the staff to almost half, the later phase saw the closure of all remaining schools and termination of all staff. Both operations were carried out in planned way with least or no social problem. In various regions project closing ceremonies were held to recount the achievements and benefits of the project and to thank the local community for their support. The closing ceremonies were participated by the local communities, government officials and head masters of neighbouring government schools. SHIKHON-II successfully leveraged its strong relations with government officials to disseminate information about SHIKHON-II’s achievements while advocating for changes in government schools to make education more accessible to the marginalized. The experience of SHIKHON-II including lessons learned is being documented by Save the Children International.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Updated:</strong> August 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\r\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->SHIKHON-II<!--:-->', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '44-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-09-13 02:36:16', '2017-09-13 02:36:16', '', 44, 'http://share-education.org/44-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The education centres provided access to 156,860 (accumulated data until 31 December 2016) hardest to reach children who otherwise would not have access to any education. Todate, 7,428 pupils successfully completed Primary Education Completion Examination (PECE) and the number of PECE graduates is estimated to increase to 10,250 at the project closure.\r\n\r\nCurrently Aloghar operates 304 schools which are fully dedicated to the education of about 15,500 adivasi/ethnic children across the country. 391 education centres comprise mixed students from ethnic and Bengali communities.  At the earlier grades i.e. pre- school to grade 2 the adivasi/ethnic children receive lessons in their mother language by teachers who also speak the same language. Aloghar produced textbooks in 8 Adivasi languages for use in its mother language based classes. On completion of the early grades the ethnic children are usually inducted into the mainstream education – government primary school (GPS) or mission schools supported by the churches.\r\n\r\nThere are 6 specialized schools which the Aloghar supports for the education of 110 disabled children. In addition, the project supports 1,284 physically disabled children with assistive devices, medical check-up charges, and relevant educational materials. The project also provides financial support for the accommodation and food for 350 geographically excluded children in Chittagong Hill Tracts.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 Aloghar increased the class contact hours from 3 hours to 4.25 hours for each of the two shifts that will contribute to improved learning. Aloghar also piloted Early Childhood Development (ECD) approach in 6 schools which is extended to another 75 schools since the beginning of 2017. Overall, the teachers continued to deliver joyful, life oriented and inclusive education to the children.\r\nAloghar carries out awareness raising and life skill activities for the communities it serves on basic education, child rights, health &amp; hygiene, child marriage and child protection. Teachers and project staff arrange life skill sessions in all Aloghar centres. So far nearly 150 thousand members of the community attended these meetings.\r\n\r\nThe Community is also actively engaged in education centre management, student survey, enrolment and student attendance, monitoring of teacher presence in school and observing special days. The community also provides food and accommodation to the teachers in remote areas as additional incentives. Education centre management committee (EMC) members generate local resources in cash and kind for the ECs and learners. In 2016 EMC organized 55 advocacy meetings to ensure free tuition fees/stipend for all primary school learners. The EMC also maintained regular networking with local government officials to seek opportunity for nationalization of the Aloghar schools. To date, two ECs were handed over to the community and 50 ECs were merged with government, NGO and church operated schools.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that at project closure in December 2017 Aloghar will have in excess of 46 thousand children at various levels of schooling who will need assistance for relocation/transfer to other educational facilities  in order to complete their current pre-primary and primary education. This includes a large number of adivasi/ethnic children who will find it harder than the non-ethnic children because of their language and cultural differences.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of important lessons to be learned from Aloghar Project experience. First, if children are taught in their mother language at very early stage it significantly enhances their participation and retention in schools. Secondly, the location of Aloghar schools seem to be carefully selected representing unserved or underserved areas, and the marginalized children most of whom are indigenous are well targeted. In addition, the backstopping of Aloghar schools by the churches enhanced their chances of success in the underprivileged community.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Updated:</strong> August 2017</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\r\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->Aloghar<!--:--><!--:bn-->আলোঘর<!--:-->', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '42-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-09-13 02:38:50', '2017-09-13 02:38:50', '', 42, 'http://share-education.org/42-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Another 8100 pupils will have been mainstreamed into government primary schools (GPS) at grade 1 having completed one-year pre-primary education (PPE) at SUSTAIN schools. There may not be any remaining pupil in any of the 39 project compounds at project closure.\r\n\r\nEnglish version of the government primary curriculum is piloted in 2 NFPE centres and comparative data between pilot and control centres showed higher English competency for students who were taught English through this approach. In 2016 a 3-day refresher training on the English curriculum for 10 NFPE teachers and 18 selected teachers from GPS were conducted in collaboration with Department of Primary Education (DPE) under the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME)..\r\n\r\nParents of slum children usually value children’s work and income over their education. However, through parenting education sessions that focused on the importance of education for children, child development, child protection, child rights and relevant policies have had positive impact on the attitude and actions of more than 20 thousand parents and 3 thousand employers to support children’s education and development under the project.\r\n\r\nSUSTAIN follows a mainstream sensitization strategy for education, which involves networking with formal school teachers and provide after school tutorial support and teacher-student sensitization in the formal schooling system. So far 36 thousand formal school students, 136 formal school management committee (SMC) and 1,737 teachers have been sensitized. Around 83 percent students of SUSTAIN were enrolled in grade 6 of secondary schools after completing PECE. Among them around 5 percent PECE graduates were enrolled in Technical and Vocational Education and Training Institutes (TVET) through the efforts of SUSTAIN.\r\n\r\nChild led advocacy is a key strategy that SUSTAIN uses in project areas for enhanced enrolment of students in the formal schools by reducing the hidden costs of education in public schools. A joint research was done by SUSTAIN and SHARE TA with the help of a local Consultant titled- “Hidden Causes and Costs that Hinder the Access of Working Children to Primary Education in Bangladesh.” SUSTAIN planned a national conference to disseminate the findings of the study.\r\n\r\nSo far there is no significant development on the reassessment of the competency for the grade 5 final examination (PECE)  reflecting the needs of hardest to reach children. However, SUSTAIN continues to keep the dialogue with relevant authorities.\r\n\r\nSUSTAIN has introduced a participatory monitoring and evaluation system using two kinds of tools - Quality Learning Environment (QLE) and Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability and Learning (MEAL). At the community level parent and school management committee provide their feedback through mood meter, parents-teachers meeting, addressing concerns received through information box and employers school visits and sharing. At partners level it is done through conducting M&amp;E visit, MIS, staff meeting, knowledge sharing meeting with formal school, half yearly and annual review workshop. At central level its done through project management steering committee (PMSC) meetings.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>\r\n\r\nEducation for the urban working children can be successfully organized when the local community, the parents, the children and their employers collaborate with each other and accept the value of education. However, during implementation the project faced difficulties in managing the rental and maintenance costs of school compounds due to devaluation of the EURO against local currency made worse by rising inflation of the local economy. Being located in urban slums the rental of the privately owned compounds is pretty high. This together with the salary costs of 3-5 teachers make the overall costs of a 5-room school compound unsustainable without continued donor or government funding.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Updated:</strong> August 2017</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div id=\"__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__zsc_once\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"__hggasdgjhsagd_once\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<!--:-->', '<!--:en-->SUSTAIN<!--:--><!--:bn-->সাস্তাইন<!--:-->', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '47-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-09-13 02:59:55', '2017-09-13 02:59:55', '', 47, 'http://share-education.org/47-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

For the first year UNIQUE-II continued to support 2,380 community-based children learning centres (CLC) established under EU funded UNIQUE-I project. At the end of first year these CLCs were transferred to local community with an enrolment of about 90,000 students. Subsequently 1850 new CLCs were established by UNIQUE-II on the basis of a baseline survey conducted in 2012. These 1,850 CLCs are reported to be in operation as of February 2017 with a total enrolment of 197,043 including about 600 adivasi children in CHT.\r\n\r\nUnder the expected result 2, a total of 1,200 learning camps were established in local government primary schools (GPS) where 28,666 low performing students of GPS received remedial academic support. For improving the quality of education, teachers and supervisors were given refresher courses. Subject based training on English and Maths were organized for teachers and supervisory staff. So far, 130 batches of subject based training were completed and a total of 2,173 teachers &amp; supervisors (1,930 female) received the training. Also, as part of foundation training, all teachers and supervisory staff of the project received training on PPE and remedial teaching camp. The NFPE teachers received pedagogic training on multi-grade teaching learning approach which is the major teaching approach developed by Dhaka Ahsania Mission. Students and teachers prepared learning materials with the locally available materials. Parents and the community participated in centre management committee (CMC) meetings in all CLCs. Joint meetings with parents and CMC members are held in every CLC for experience sharing and day to day management of the CLCs.\r\n\r\nUnder the expected result 3 UNIQUE-II engaged local government officials in various interventions. Union Parishad Standing Committees on Education (USCE) is a part of local government at union level that takes initiatives for improving education in respective unions.

Conceptual issues regarding the role and responsibilities of the TA project within the broader framework of SHARE were clarified and all key stakeholders of SHARE projects have been engaged in interactive roles through frequent meetings of the SHARE Coordination Group (SCG) and regular consultations with EUD. Meaningful networking with GOB agencies is established, and the potential benefits of SHARE programme to the larger NGO community has been recognized. Policy and action research in NFPE have been initiated, and upgraded EMIS and website have been established.\r\n\r\nIn order to strengthen the capacity of result-based management via monitoring and evaluation a M&amp;E Toolkit was prepared and disseminated through a participating process where all project personnel, consultant and the TA team were involved in a highly collaborative manner.\r\n\r\nThe TA team published and distributed three comprehensive SHARE Annual Reports since 2014 and organized four Annual Conferences which were considered huge success in terms of wider participation, quality of discussions and high relevance of the themes selected. These are all documented and shared with stakeholders.\r\n\r\nFollowing the 3<sup>rd</sup> annual conference held in June 2015 a community based schooling quality improvement Initiative (CBSQ-I) was established as an alliance of about 20 like-minded NGOs. CBSQ-I conducted series of activities through which a common quality framework for basic education together with a set of minimum service standards was established. This will serve as a benchmark of quality in NGO schools.\r\n\r\nA key task of the TA is to capture, support and document the innovations and good practices developed and implemented by the partner NGOs and to reflect and learn from each other’s experience. This is being achieved through cross field visits of NGO projects; advocacy and networking between GO and NGOs; and upstream research activities and sharing of the research outcomes.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, six cross field visits were conducted in various parts of the country.

Conceptual issues regarding the role and responsibilities of the TA project within the broader framework of SHARE were clarified and all key stakeholders of SHARE projects have been engaged in interactive roles through frequent meetings of the SHARE Coordination Group (SCG) and regular consultations with EUD. Meaningful networking with GOB agencies is established, and the potential benefits of SHARE programme to the larger NGO community has been recognized. Policy and action research in NFPE have been initiated, and upgraded EMIS and website have been established.\r\n\r\nIn order to strengthen the capacity of result-based management via monitoring and evaluation a M&amp;E Toolkit was prepared and disseminated through a participating process where all project personnel, consultant and the TA team were involved in a highly collaborative manner.\r\n\r\nThe TA team published and distributed three comprehensive SHARE Annual Reports since 2014 and organized four Annual Conferences which were considered huge success in terms of wider participation, quality of discussions and high relevance of the themes selected. These are all documented and shared with stakeholders.\r\n\r\nFollowing the 3<sup>rd</sup> annual conference held in June 2015 a community based schooling quality improvement Initiative (CBSQ-I) was established as an alliance of about 20 like-minded NGOs. CBSQ-I conducted series of activities through which a common quality framework for basic education together with a set of minimum service standards was established. This will serve as a benchmark of quality in NGO schools.\r\n\r\nA key task of the TA is to capture, support and document the innovations and good practices developed and implemented by the partner NGOs and to reflect and learn from each other’s experience. This is being achieved through cross field visits of NGO projects; advocacy and networking between GO and NGOs; and upstream research activities and sharing of the research outcomes.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, six cross field visits were conducted in various parts of the country. Each one was participated by SHARE and Non-SHARE NGOs including BRAC, NETZ, Educo, GSS, Plan International and CAMPE. The cross-field visits enabled participants to see field level practice of other than their own, which has relevance to their work and from which they will gained new knowledge and reflective skills.
